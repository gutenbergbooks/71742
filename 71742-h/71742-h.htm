<span class="fs80">WHERE THE PINS GO.</span></h2>

<p>“I wonder where all the pins go,” said
Harry to himself, as he examined the lapel of
his coat, where he was sure he had stuck two or
three that very morning.</p>

<p>Of course Harry was not the first boy who
had thus wondered, but it was the first time
the question had ever occurred to him. If he
wanted a pin the only sure place to find one was
on his mother’s cushion, because that was kept
filled with new ones. But what became of all the
old ones? He himself would sometimes lose
several in a day, and yet he hardly ever found
one, no matter how carefully he might look.</p>

<p>Just now, however, he saw one lying in the
path before him, and was about to pick it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
up, when suddenly it vanished from sight. He
rubbed his eyes and looked again, but it was
certainly gone.</p>

<p>“That’s funny!” he thought; “I’m sure it
was there.”</p>

<p>Stooping over, he put out his hand and seemed
to touch something soft. He closed his hand
and started back, when to his amazement he
found in his grasp an object that looked like a
small, round, pointed hat.</p>

<p>Now Harry knew a thing or two. He had
read all about fairies and elves, and had seen
pictures of them, and he concluded at once
that this must be an elf’s hat. He put it on
his head without delay, and sure enough, just as
he expected, there stood an elf before him.</p>

<p>“Please give me back my hat,” said the little
creature, in a beseeching tone.</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied Harry. “I’ve read about
you elves, and I know you are my servant while
I have your hat. I want to see where you live,
and all that. And—oh! yes,” he exclaimed as a
thought struck him; “what became of that pin
that was here in the path? Did you take it?”</p>

<p>The elf nodded, and held out his hand, in
which lay the pin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image003" style="max-width: 35.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image003.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“‘PLEASE GIVE ME BACK MY HAT.’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“So that is the reason it disappeared,” said
Harry. “Why did you pick it up?”</p>

<p>“That’s my work,” responded the elf. “I belong
to the Pin Elves. We have to gather up
the pins that you mortals lose or throw away.”</p>

<p>“How funny!” cried Harry. “But what do
you do with them?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the elf, “a long time ago our
king ran a needle in his foot. Now we have a
law that whoever injures the King’s person shall
be banished. Of course the King could not
banish himself, so he had to banish all the
needles. No sewing could be done after that,
so we gradually took to using pins for fastening
our clothes together, and now we need so many
that most of our work is pin-gathering. That
is the reason we are called the Pin Elves.”</p>

<p>Harry looked at the little fellow curiously and
saw that his garments had neither button nor
sewed seam. Shoes, stockings, tight breeches,
belted coat,—all were fastened together with pins.</p>

<p>“But I thought that you elves worked at
night only,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“So we do, usually,” responded the elf, “but
some of us occasionally are sent out on a dark,
cloudy day like this, when there is little danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
of the sun shining upon us. I had bad luck
last night, didn’t find a pin, so my master made
me come out again to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am your master now,” said Harry,
“so you can stop work and go home. Only,
you must take me with you.”</p>

<p>Off they started, the elf leading, in the direction
of Central Park. The elfin hat which
Harry wore made him invisible, and the elf
himself of course was visible only to Harry;
therefore they attracted no attention as they
walked up the Avenue and along Fifty-ninth
Street. They entered the Park at the Sixth
Avenue gate, and went a little way until they
came to a small rock with a rather flat top.</p>

<p>The elf scrambled up on this, and sticking a
pin in a little hole in the centre and pressing
upon it thrice, sang in a queer, croaking voice
the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pin, pin, let me in.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Needles are banished,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All of them vanished;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I am a trusty Pin.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Immediately a door in the rock opened, disclosing
a flight of stairs, down which the elf
conducted Harry. The stairs ended in a small,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
well-lighted room, with several passageways leading
out of it. They entered one of these, and
after walking a short distance, came to a long,
steep incline, the floor of which shone like
polished glass.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Harry in alarm; “that’s
too steep and slippery to walk on. It looks
like glass.”</p>

<p>“It is glass,” said the elf, “and we are
going to slide down. You needn’t be afraid.
It’s safe enough, and I’ll go in front.”</p>

<p>He sat down on the brow of the hill, and
continued: “You sit down behind me and
stick your feet on each side of me, and I’ll
steer you straight. All ready? Well, here
goes! Hold on to my hat!”</p>

<p>Whiz! away they went, and in about ten
seconds reached the bottom, where a short,
level space with a gentle rise at the end of
it brought them to a gradual standstill.</p>

<p>“Glorious!” exclaimed Harry, springing to
his feet. “Beats coasting all hollow! Let’s go
back and try it again.”</p>

<p>“No, we must hasten on,” replied the elf;
“the King holds a reception this afternoon,
and no one is permitted to be absent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>They hurried along the passage and presently
came to a door, before which stood two
tall elves, each one armed with a long spear.
Harry’s elf whispered a word to these guards,
and they instantly opened the door.</p>

<p>On they trotted; that is, the elf trotted, but
Harry simply walked at a good pace, through
several more passageways, until finally they
reached another door, guarded like the first,
through which they were admitted to the Grand
Royal Reception Hall.</p>

<p>It was a room of immense size, brilliantly
lighted by what seemed to be strings of precious
stones festooned from the lofty ceiling.
At the further end, on a raised dais, was the
King, seated upon a throne of gold, with his
royal body-guard of five hundred picked soldiers
stationed near him. On a lower platform
at the right of the King were seated a few persons,
who, Harry’s elf informed him, were members
of the royal family.</p>

<p>The hall was otherwise quite vacant, as the
reception was just beginning, so they stood at
one side and watched the elves coming in.</p>

<p>“There is my old master, the Lord of the
Safety-Pin,” said the elf to Harry, as a surly-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
elf entered, whose clothes were fastened
with numerous safety-pins. “See him
scowl at us; he knows you are my master
now. Those elves behind him are his knights.
Each knight has two esquires and twelve
retainers; any retainer who finds a good safety-pin
becomes an esquire, and if he finds another
he is made a knight; but he can’t become a lord
until he has found enough to pin all his clothes
together. There is only one lord of that order,
because you mortals don’t lose many good
safety-pins, and a broken one doesn’t count.</p>

<p>“Those two fellows coming now are Knights
of the Breast-Pin. Each of them found one
breast-pin, and the King made them knights.
They are the only members of their order.</p>

<p>“Here come the Black-Pins. There are six
lords, seventy-two knights, a hundred and forty-four
esquires, and I don’t know how many retainers.
They are rather a common lot,” he
added contemptuously.</p>

<p>After the Black-Pins had passed, there entered
a pompous elf with a large hat-pin hanging
like a sword from his belt. At sight of
him Harry’s elf bowed very low.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“One of the Hat-Pins,” replied the elf in a
whisper; “belongs to the royal family, you
know. The King’s sceptre is a gold-headed hat-pin,
and any one who finds a hat-pin is made a
member of the royal family.”</p>

<p>Just then a messenger summoned them to
appear before the King.</p>

<p>“There is one rule you must bear in mind,
while you are in this hall,” said the elf to
Harry, as they followed the messenger; “no
one is permitted to turn his back to the King.”</p>

<p>Half-way down the hall they came to the
Lord of the Safety-Pin, who looked so ugly
and hateful that Harry could not help smiling.
Just after they passed him, Hairy felt a sharp
pin-prick in his leg, and turning about hastily,
discovered that it had been inflicted by the
Lord of the Safety-Pin himself.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” cried that individual, with a
malicious grin, “<em>you have turned your back
on the King</em>!”</p>

<p>The King spoke a few words to his body-guard,
and instantly a large number of them
started towards Harry.</p>

<p>“Quick! you must escape!” cried the elf
whose hat he possessed. “Follow me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Harry was inclined to stand his ground, but
on second thoughts it seemed wiser to run, so
he followed his little friend through a side
doorway and on through many corridors and
up numerous flights of stairs until they arrived
at the chamber where they had first entered.
The elf ran up the steps, and taking a pin
from his coat inserted it in a small hole in
the rock overhead, and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Pin, pin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trusty and stout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I am within</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And want to get out.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The door in the rock opened, and they
stepped out into the open air.</p>

<p>“We’re safe now,” said the elf, and he
slammed the door shut, just as the foremost
of the pursuing soldiers began to mount the
stairs. “Now, please give me my hat!” he
added imploringly.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Harry. “You must go
home with me; I’m not going to walk the
streets bareheaded and visible.”</p>

<p>When they reached the house Harry bade
the elf wait a minute, and removing the elfin
hat from his head, he went up to his mother’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
room, and took an old hat-pin from a closet.
Stopping on his way back at the sitting-room
door, he obtained his mother’s permission to
keep it, and then ran out to the elf.</p>

<p>“You have been a good servant,” said he,
“and here is your reward.”</p>

<p>The elf’s little black eyes sparkled with
pleasure as he took it, and he drew himself
up proudly, saying: “Now I shall become a
member of the royal family. And here,” he
continued, drawing a pin from his coat, and
handing it to Harry, “is a token of my gratitude.
If you ever want to see me, go to that
rock in the Park; in the centre of the top
you will find a small hole; stick this pin in
the hole, and while you press upon it thrice,
repeat these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pin, pin, let me in.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Needles are banished,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All of them vanished;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A mortal wants to get in.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Thank you,” said Harry. “Good-by, little
chap. Here’s your hat,” and he tossed it to the
elf, who instantly disappeared.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Harry, as he entered the house,
“I’ve certainly found out where the pins go.”</p>

<span class="fs80">TAKEN PRISONER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One Saturday, some months after Harry’s
adventure among the Pin Elves, an irresistible
desire came over him to pay another visit to
the little underground people; so having obtained
his mother’s consent to spend the afternoon
in the Park, he took the pin given him
by his elfin friend, put in his pocket a little
gift for him, and started off.</p>

<p>The rock which contained the hidden door
was situated close to a footpath and when he
reached it he sat down upon it as if to rest,
and looked about to see if any one were
watching him. No one was in sight but a
Park policeman, who had just passed by, and
he was disappearing from view among the
shrubbery. So Harry hurriedly examined the
centre of the rock, and in a few moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
found the hole. Inserting the pin, he pressed
upon it thrice, and repeated</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pin, pin, let me in.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Needles are banished,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All of them vanished;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A mortal wants to get in.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Instantly the door in the top of the rock
opened, and Harry found himself lying on the
grass beside the rock. In his excitement he
had forgotten just where the door was, and, as
he was resting exactly on top of it, when it
sprang open it naturally threw him off the rock.
Fortunately he was not hurt, though he was
very much surprised.</p>

<p>It took but a moment, however, to pick himself
up, snatch the elfin pin from the hole, and
spring down the stone steps through the open
doorway. As his foot touched the bottom, the
trap-door in the rock above shut noiselessly.</p>

<p>The chamber in which he found himself was
empty, so he entered the passageway which he
had traversed with the elf on his former visit,
slid down the glassy incline, and walked onwards
until he came to the first door. As no
one was there, and as there seemed to be no way
for him to open the door, he knocked upon it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
as loudly as possible, and stepping back a little
waited for a response.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened about half-way, but
closed again just as suddenly without any one
appearing. After waiting awhile longer, Harry
knocked again till his knuckles were sore, and
when no answer came, he kicked vigorously
against the rocky barrier.</p>

<p>Finally he grew tired, and sat down. What
to do next he hardly knew. It was impossible
to go back the way he came, as he could not
walk up the glassy incline. He had seen no
passageway opening out of the one in which he
was, and there seemed to be no other door than
the one just ahead. Evidently, there was nothing
to do but to wait until some of the elves
happened along that way.</p>

<p>The silence at first was painful; but after
a little while he fancied he heard mysterious
sounds around him, like the rustling of garments,
and soft footfalls, and once or twice what
seemed to be a faint whispering. No one was visible,
and he had almost concluded that he had
merely imagined the sounds, when there came a
sharp click just beside him, as if a piece of metal
had struck the rocky side of the passageway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, much startled and
frightened, but there was nothing to be seen,
and as he listened intently, he could not hear
the slightest sound.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! I’m simply nervous!” he exclaimed,
seating himself again.</p>

<p>But scarcely had he become quiet, when he
felt something like a rope drawn tightly about
his arms and feet, and then he was pulled over
on his back upon the ground. He made a
desperate effort to free himself, but both arms
and legs were so strongly bound that all struggling
was in vain; so he lay there perfectly
quiet, half frightened out of his wits.</p>

<p>In a few moments, he was dragged on his
back upon what seemed to be a long, wide
board, and then the board, with him upon it,
was lifted up and carried through a number of
passageways, and finally set down again on the
ground. The board was then gently pulled from
under him, there was a confused rustling sound,
the bonds on his limbs suddenly loosened, and
all became quiet.</p>

<p>Harry sprang to his feet and found himself in
a small chamber about twelve feet square, with
apparently neither door nor window. Of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
he knew there must be a doorway somewhere,
as he had just been brought through one; but
he was unable to discover any sign of it now.
The room was well lighted in some way from
the lofty ceiling, and contained a long, low couch
along one of the walls.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image017" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image017.jpg" alt="Boy sitting">
</figure>

<p>Harry carefully examined his prison, and then
sat down on the edge of the couch, and gave a
long whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Well!” he cried, “this <em>is</em> a lark and no
mistake! I wish I could get out of this hole.”</p>

<p>But it needed only a glance at those bare
stone walls to show him the uselessness of such
a wish. Finally he gave up thinking about his
strange situation, and being thoroughly tired
out, threw himself back on the couch, and was
soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>On awakening, the first object that met his
gaze was a low table beside him, covered with
a tempting display of food.</p>

<p>“Well!” he exclaimed, rubbing his eyes in
amazement, “if it isn’t just like magic!”</p>

<p>The food smelled good, and also tasted good,
as he soon discovered; and when he had finished
eating there was little of it left. After that, he
walked around the room a number of times, and
then lay down and slept again.</p>

<p>When he awoke the second time, the little
table had disappeared. While he lay there, half
dozing, he saw a door in the opposite side of the
room noiselessly open and immediately close
again. A moment later, something soft touched
his head, and he beheld his old elfin friend
standing beside him, nodding and grinning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Hallo!” cried Harry, sitting upright, “how
did you get here?”</p>

<p>“Sh—sh!” said the elf, “don’t talk so loud!
I came in at the door just now.”</p>

<p>“How’s that? I didn’t see you,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” was the reply; “we
elves are invisible to any mortal who hasn’t
one of our hats on. You see me now because
I just put my hat on your head.”</p>

<p>“Well, say, old fellow, or whatever your
name may be—what is your name, by the
way?”</p>

<p>“Wamby,” answered the elf.</p>

<p>“Well, Wamby,” continued Harry, “why am
I shut up here, and what is going to be done
with me?”</p>

<p>The elf answered: “You are shut up because
at your former visit you turned your back on
the King. When to-day you came to that door
near the foot of the hill of glass, you could see
no one because you hadn’t one of our hats on;
but the two guards were there, and while one
remained to watch you, the other carried the
news to the King. Instantly, a body of soldiers
was sent to seize you, and carry you to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
prison. I was unable to prevent it, but I made
up my mind to see you, and so I deliberately
turned <em>my</em> back on the King and, of course, was
at once arrested and brought here as a prisoner
too. As to what is to be done with us, I believe
they intend to send us down to work with
the Gnomes.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?” asked Harry. “And who
are the Gnomes?”</p>

<p>“Why, the Gnomes are the elves who work
in the mines far down in the earth, way down
below where we are. They are bad fellows,
those Gnomes, black and ugly, and awfully old.
They dig gold and silver and iron, and have big
forges where they make lots of things. It’s
very hot down there, and they have to stay
there all the time. One of the worst punishments
that can befall a Pin Elf is to be sent to
work with the Gnomes. No one ever is permitted
to return, and there is no chance to
escape from the mines.”</p>

<p>“Well, can’t we escape from this place
before they carry us down to the Gnomes?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p>Wamby shook his head dolefully. “No,” he
replied; “they’ve taken away the pin with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
I opened doors, and we can’t get out any other
way.”</p>

<p>“Here is the pin you gave me,” said Harry.
“Won’t that do just as well?”</p>

<p>Wamby eagerly took the pin, but his countenance
soon fell again. “I’m afraid it’s no use
for us to try,” he said; “come over here and
look. Don’t speak a word.”</p>

<p>Going across to the opposite side of the room,
he waited till Harry was close beside him, and
then sticking the pin in a hole in the wall, he
pressed upon it thrice, and whispered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Pin, pin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trusty and stout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I am within,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And want to look out.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The door opened a crack, and Wamby stepped
aside and motioned Harry to take a peep. Harry
did so, and saw that the passageway was fairly
filled with elves of the largest size, each one
armed with a long spear. He counted them,
and found there were fifty keeping careful
guard. Then the door closed quietly.</p>

<p>Wamby turned around and threw himself
hopelessly upon the couch. “Take that pin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
out of the hole,” he said; “it may be of use
to us some time.”</p>

<p>Harry snatched it out impatiently, and
dropped it on the floor. “Pshaw!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired the elf.</p>

<p>“I dropped the pin and can’t find it again,”
said Harry. “Oh! here it is, sticking in a hole
in the floor.”</p>

<p>“What! in a hole?” cried Wamby, springing
up excitedly. “Don’t touch it! Let me see!
If there’s a hole, there must be a trap-door; and
if there is, it will give us a chance of escape.”</p>

<p>He kneeled down and rapped softly upon the
floor, and listened intently.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s a door here. Stand aside, and
I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>He pressed upon the pin and repeated the
usual words, and a trap-door opened in the
floor, revealing a narrow passage, with stone
steps descending.</p>

<p>“Where does it lead to?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Wamby replied; “but we
can soon find out.” He considered a moment,
and then continued, “We’d better wait awhile,
though. They’ll bring in our food before long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
and if they find us gone they will start at once
in pursuit and catch us. But if we wait until
after the food is brought, it will give us time to
get away a good distance before our flight is
discovered.”</p>

<p>It was well they took that precaution, for
hardly was the trap-door closed when the other
door opened, and four elves appeared, bearing
a table laden with eatables. After the meal
was despatched, Harry put in his pockets the
food that remained, as it might be some time
before they could obtain any more. Then,
waiting until the four elves had returned and
removed the empty table, they opened the trap-door
and descended a few steps, when the door
above them silently closed, and they were in
total darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br>
<span class="fs80">PURSUED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“What shall we do now?” asked Harry in
dismay, catching Wamby by the arm. “We
can never go on in this darkness.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, and I’ll show you,” replied
the elf.</p>

<p>He seemed to search about his person for
something, and presently held out his hand, in
which was a box containing a little round object
that shone like an electric light, and lighted
up the passageway brilliantly.</p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired Harry in wonder.</p>

<p>“A kind of gem that the gnomes make. We
use them to light up all our rooms, and when
one is put in a box like this it is like a dark
lantern, only better, being so small and bright.
But, come on! we are wasting precious time.”</p>

<p>The stone stairs seemed interminable, but at
last they reached the bottom, and hurried along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
a corridor that still slanted slightly downward.
After a long walk they came to the brow of a
steep incline.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” asked Harry, “another hill
of glass?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Wamby replied, sitting down. “Sit
down behind me and we’ll slide.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Harry, “we’ve
been going down for an hour or more, and if
we don’t stop I’m afraid we’ll come to the centre
of the earth. Where does this road lead
to, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Wamby calmly, “I think,
from the way it keeps going down hill, that it
must lead to the Gnomes; in fact, I am quite
sure that this is the way they take prisoners
there.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the case,” said Harry, “please
excuse me from going any further. I may be
carried down, but I’m not such a fool as to go
down of my own free will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on!” said Wamby; “don’t be
afraid! If we go down of our own accord we
can come back at any time. You’ll understand
later. Although I have never been to
the Gnomes, I have often heard the soldiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
who have taken prisoners there, tell stories
about the trip, and I think I know pretty well
what the remainder of the road is like. Sit
down close behind me and take hold of my
belt, and keep your mouth tightly shut.”</p>

<p>“All right, go ahead,” said Harry.</p>

<p>Away they went, faster and faster, until
Harry felt as if his breath were gone. Would
the hill never end?</p>

<p>“Can’t—you—put on—the brakes—Wamby?”
he gasped.</p>

<p>“Keep your mouth shut, and hold on!”
shrieked the elf.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” thought Harry, “I wish I could
hold on!”</p>

<p>But they reached the foot of the hill safely
after awhile. Harry sat still until he had recovered
his breath, and then, slowly arising, ruefully
rubbed his benumbed legs, and said:</p>

<p>“I tell you what, old chap, if you ever want
me to slide down that place again, you’ll have
to provide a cushion for me.”</p>

<p>Wamby chuckled, and trotted onward. After
another long walk through a level corridor they
came to the entrance of an immense chamber
or cave, so large that they could see neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the roof, nor opposite sides. The floor was
smooth and glistening, and reflected the light
which Wamby held aloft.</p>

<p>“What is the floor—glass?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the elf, “it’s water. We shall
have to go the rest of the way in a boat. Let
me show you something,” he continued, catching
Harry by the sleeve, and shutting the lid
of his lantern-box. “Look way over there, a
little to the left, and tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>“Why, it looks like a little red star. It
flickers a good deal. Sometimes it blazes up
brightly, and then it gets so faint that I can
scarcely see it. What is it?”</p>

<p>“It is where the Gnomes live. That star, as
you call it, is the light from their furnace fires;
and when I tell you it is as bright as day over there,
you can see how far away it must be from us.”</p>

<p>“But how can we ever get there?” demanded
Harry.</p>

<p>“You’ll see presently,” was the answer.
“First, let us eat some of that food you
brought. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>They hastily swallowed a few mouthfuls, and
quenched their thirst with a draught of cool,
clear water from the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Now, give me that pin,” said Wamby.
Opening a large door at one side, he disclosed
a room with the floor covered with water, on
which floated a sail-boat with its sails all set.
“Here,” he continued, “take hold of that bowline,
and while I shove, you pull the boat around
alongside of the landing-place there. Now, fasten
the stern-line over that stone post, and get
in the boat, and shove the bow out a little.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wamby had taken a piece of hose
from the room, and fastening one end on the
wall, he placed the other end on the edge of
the landing-place with the nozzle pointing
straight at the red star. Then he turned a
stop-cock, and instantly there came a strange,
rushing sound from the nozzle of the hose.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Harry, much alarmed.</p>

<p>“Oh! that is only the wind that I just turned
on,” said Wamby. “All we have to do is to
push the boat in front of this hose, and the
wind will blow us across the lake.”</p>

<p>“But how can we get back again if it blows
so hard from this side?” inquired Harry.</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” responded Wamby. “This
wind only blows long enough to carry us across,
and then stops of itself. Now I’ll put my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
lantern-box on this shelf, so that when we come
back we’ll know where to steer. We won’t need it
till we get back again. And now we’re all ready.”</p>

<p>He cast off the stern-line and was just about
to step aboard, when he suddenly stopped, and
cried, “Listen!”</p>

<p>Harry listened, but could hear nothing. The
elf’s ears were sharper, though, and he exclaimed,
“I hear the sound of rapid footsteps up
the passageway. Push off from shore—quick!”</p>

<p>Springing into the boat, he grasped a pole
and shoved off a few feet from the edge. No
sooner had he done so, when the fifty elves
who had been guarding them came running up,
waving their spears and shouting to them to
return. Of course they refused, whereupon the
leader of the soldiers ran to the hose and turned
off the wind. Then he held aloft his spear, and
cried, “In the King’s name, surrender!”</p>

<p>At the sound of that, Wamby fairly trembled,
and seemed disposed to obey. But Harry
pushed him aside, and called out boldly, “What
do you want?”</p>

<p>“We want you to give yourselves up as
prisoners. If you refuse, we shall have to swim
out and capture you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Harry turned to Wamby: “What do you
say? Shall we fight them?”</p>

<p>Poor little Wamby shook his head hopelessly.</p>

<p>“I’ll fight if you command me to; I am your
servant; but it will do no good. There are
too many of them.”</p>

<p>“What can we do, then?” inquired Harry.</p>

<p>“Nothing, except go back,” said Wamby.
“Dear me! I wish I had my hat-pin now!”</p>

<p>“What good would that do?”</p>

<p>“Why, then we could control them. But
they took away my hat-pin, of course, when
they arrested me.”</p>

<p>Harry thrust his hand in his pocket and drew
forth a package. “See here, Wamby,” said he,
“here’s a hat-pin that I brought down as a
present for you, but I forgot all about it till
this moment. Would this be any good?” He
opened the package and showed a large, gold-headed
hat-pin, much like the one belonging to
the King, only handsomer.</p>

<p>“Just the thing!” cried Wamby. And
grasping the pin in his hand he held it up
before him, and sprang upon the seat in the
boat’s stern, shouting: “Behold the royal
emblem!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>At the sight, every soldier dropped his spear,
and bowed low to the ground.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed Wamby. “You have
made a mistake, my brave men, but we’ll overlook
it this time. You, Smithkin, go and turn
on the wind!”</p>

<p>The leader of the soldiers, thus commanded,
immediately obeyed.</p>

<p>“Rise!” said Wamby. “Have you food
with you?”</p>

<p>Smithkin bowed low, and replied: “We have,
most noble possessor of the royal hat-pin.”</p>

<p>“Then hearken,” continued Wamby. “Sit
down where you are, and remain seated until
we return.” Then, turning to Harry, he grinned
and said, “Shove the boat over into the wind.”</p>

<p>“Will they stay here?” whispered Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; never fear. They wouldn’t dare
leave,” answered Wamby, sticking the hat-pin
in his belt, and pushing the boat along.</p>

<p>Presently the wind struck the sails, the boat
started rapidly forward into the gloom, and
Wamby, sitting down in the stern, took the
tiller and steered for the little red spot that
showed where the Gnomes lived.</p>

<span class="fs80">A TRIP TO THE GNOMES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Wamby,” said Harry, after they had sailed
for some time in silence, “what are we going
to the Gnomes for?”</p>

<p>“I have some friends there that I want to
see,” replied Wamby.</p>

<p>“Are there many of the Pin Elves there?”</p>

<p>“A great many. I once counted up over
five hundred that I knew of, and there are a
large number of others who have been sent
there.”</p>

<p>“What are they sent for, breaking the
laws?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no. I myself am the only one I ever
knew of who deliberately broke a law. The
others were banished for displeasing the King.
For instance, twelve friends of mine were sent
to the Gnomes at one time, simply because
they contradicted the King. He declared that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the katydids had more beautiful voices than
the crickets, and because they refused to agree
with him they were banished. Then there was
Kitey, a dear friend of mine, but an awful big
fool in one way. He was so afraid of turning
his back on the King that he never took his
eyes off the King’s face when in the royal
presence. One day at a banquet Kitey sat
next to me, and I told him a funny story and
made him laugh. Of course he was looking
at the King all the time, and just then the
King unluckily spilt some soup on his royal
mantle, and seeing Kitey looking at him and
laughing, he thought he was laughing at <em>him</em>;
so away Kitey went to the Gnomes.”</p>

<p>“It’s shameful!” exclaimed Harry, indignantly.
“Why do you stand it? I should think
all of you would hate such a wicked King.”</p>

<p>“Well, everybody does hate him,” said
Wamby, “except a few persons, like the Lord
of the Safety-Pin, who are the King’s favorites.
But what can you do?”</p>

<p>“Do!” cried Harry, “why, elect another
King.”</p>

<p>“Elect another King!” repeated Wamby, as
if bewildered at the very idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harry. “He’s the wickedest old
tyrant I ever heard of. If most of you dislike
him, the best thing to do is to choose some
good elf as King, and send the old one off.”</p>

<p>“But that would be rebellion,” said Wamby,
faintly. The project was so bold that it fairly
took his breath away.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Harry, “it would be a
revolution, and that is perfectly right in a case
like this.”</p>

<p>“But the King has all the soldiers under his
command,” said Wamby.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Harry, “what do they
amount to! There must be thousands of you
Pin Elves, and you could easily conquer five
hundred soldiers.”</p>

<p>“It’s all well enough to talk,” returned
Wamby, “but you forget another very serious
fact, and that is the effect of the royal hat-pin,
and the awe and terror it always inspires.
You yourself have seen how easily I controlled
those soldiers with the hat-pin; but imagine
how much greater would be the effect if it
were in the King’s hands.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Harry, “I never thought
of that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>After a long silence he crawled back to the
stern of the boat, and sat down beside Wamby.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="image035" style="max-width: 24.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image035.jpg" alt="Two boys sitting">
</figure>

<p>“Look here, Wamby,”
he said, “I have an idea.”
And then he began a long
whispered conversation
with the elf, as if afraid
to let even the darkness
around them hear what he
had to say.</p>

<p>Finally Wamby said,
“Well, I am doubtful about
it; but you are my master,
and if you command me to
do it, I shall have to obey.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I forgot I
had your hat on my head,”
said Harry, feeling to
make sure that the hat
was still there. “Well,
then, I command you to do
it. Does that settle the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that settles it,” replied the elf.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they had been drawing near the
other shore. The little red star had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
gradually growing larger and brighter, and they
began now to see clearly the brilliant, ruddy,
furnace fires, and to distinguish the forms of
Gnomes moving about at their work. The
heat had become so intense that Harry took
off his coat and vest, and wet his head a
number of times with the cool water.</p>

<p>As they drew close to the shore, Wamby
steered the boat aside out of the direct current
of wind, and it gradually slowed up and
stopped alongside of a landing-place. They
both stepped out, and Wamby made the boat
fast.</p>

<p>“You’d better take a good drink,” said he
to Harry, “and wet your handkerchief and tie
it around your head. It’s awfully hot here.”</p>

<p>“How do they stand it?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh! the Gnomes are used to it. But
you notice there are no Pin Elves here. It is
too hot for them. They work in the mines,
digging out the metal. Of course it’s warm
enough there, but not nearly so bad as this.”</p>

<p>He drew forth the hat-pin from his belt, and
held it up before some soldiers standing near,
“Here, you!” he said to one of them, “keep
guard over that boat!” Then addressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
another soldier: “And you, go ahead and lead
us straight to your King. Trot along lively!
We haven’t any time to spare, and even if we
had, it’s too hot to loiter here.”</p>

<p>They hastened away as fast as possible, but
although they were running briskly, and although
Harry himself was most anxious to escape
from the terrible heat, he could not refrain
from casting several curious glances about him.
It was indeed a strange and weird scene.
Long rows of fiercely glowing furnaces, with
scores of misshapen, hideous-looking Gnomes
busily at work; some bringing loads of freshly-dug
ore in funny little wheelbarrows; some
tending the fires and stirring the redhot coals
with long pokers; some with big ladles skimming
the refuse from the top of the molten
metal, or pouring it from the crucibles into
moulds; some trotting away with barrows full
of new-made gold and silver bars. Then, further
along, were hundreds of forges, with Gnomes
still more ugly working the metals into all
sorts of beautiful and curious forms.</p>

<p>Had it not been so terribly hot, Harry would
gladly have stopped and watched them; but as it
was, he was very willing to hurry by as fast as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
his legs could carry him, and was thankful when
they entered a corridor and shut a stone door
behind them. It was still warm, of course,
being so far down in the earth, but the temperature
was comfortable, as compared with the
intense heat from the fires.</p>

<p>Presently they reached a large hall, with the
floor covered with pure gold, the sides covered
with silver, and the ceiling inlaid with countless
precious stones. The light was so brilliant and
dazzling that Harry was half blinded, and had
to shade his eyes for some moments before he
could see anything.</p>

<p>At the further end of the hall was the King
of the Gnomes on his throne. On each side of
him sat the Grand Prime Minister and the Grand
Recorder, and beside them were ranged a double
row of armed soldiers.</p>

<p>It seemed to Harry that the Gnomes had
picked out the oldest and ugliest one of their
number for King, and then the next two ugliest
ones for Prime Minister and Recorder. The
King had an immense gray beard, so long and
bushy that the ends of it were spread out on the
floor in front of him like a rug. In his right
hand he held, as a sceptre, a small golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
pickax, to show that all the wealth of his kingdom
came from the mines.</p>

<p>As Harry and Wamby drew near the throne,
the King growled forth, “What do you want?”</p>

<p>Wamby held forth the hat-pin, and replied,
“We are come to demand of you to deliver to
us every Pin Elf now in Your Majesty’s dominions.”</p>

<p>“Hum! hah!” growled the King, frowning
terribly. He looked first at the Grand Prime
Minister, and then at the Grand Recorder, as
much as to say, “What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>Those two worthies of course knew better
than to make any reply. They simply bowed
very low, as if to say, “We think whatever
Your Majesty is pleased to think.”</p>

<p>Then the King stared at his golden pickax
with his right eye, which, by the way, was much
larger than the other eye, and had a most horrible
glare.</p>

<p>“Hum! hah!” he muttered again, and turned
that awful eye of his upon Harry.</p>

<p>The poor boy was shaking in his shoes from
fright, but he returned the King’s gaze with
a bold countenance.</p>

<p>“Shall we run, Wamby?” he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“No, keep still, or we’re lost!” replied the elf.</p>

<p>Finally the King summoned an officer, and
said, in a snarling tone, “Take a hundred soldiers,
and bring hither all of the Pin Elves in
my dominions. Begone!”</p>

<p>Presently the officer returned with the elves.
They looked astonished and bewildered when
they saw Harry and Wamby, and bowed low to
the King of the Gnomes and then to the royal
hat-pin, but of course were afraid to say a
word.</p>

<p>“There they are,” growled the King, with
a rather menacing wave of his pickax. “Take
them, and begone!”</p>

<p>Nothing loth, they all retired from the room
as fast as they could back out.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll run ahead and get the boats
ready,” said Wamby, “and the rest of you
hurry after me before the King has a chance
to change his mind and stop us.”</p>

<p>By the time they reached the lake, Wamby
had a fleet of boats in waiting, and had adjusted
a piece of hose and turned on the wind. It
took but a moment for them to tumble aboard
and push the boats into the wind, and they were
soon sailing rapidly towards home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="fs80">CAUGHT IN A TRAP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When they arrived at the opposite side of
the lake they found the fifty soldiers seated on
the exact spot where they had left them.</p>

<p>A number of Gnomes had been brought over
in order that they might take their own vessels
back, and the first thing Wamby did was to
order the wind turned on, and start the fleet
of the Gnomes on their homeward way. Next,
he commanded the soldiers to arise, proceed
a little distance up the passageway, and take
their station at the entrance of another passageway
leading off towards the right, which Harry
had not noticed before.</p>

<p>“It leads up to the Grand Royal Reception
Hall,” explained Wamby, in answer to an inquiry
from Harry. “Of course you know it
is impossible to go back the way we came
down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Then Wamby led Kitey aside from the other
elves, and whispered to him long and earnestly.
As Kitey listened he looked first amazed and
then delighted, and finally a broad grin overspread
his face, and with a knowing nod he ran
off and began in a low voice to address the various
groups of elves scattered about.</p>

<p>“Did you tell Kitey everything?” inquired
Harry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Wamby, “and he is telling
the others. We can trust them all.”</p>

<p>“How about the soldiers? do they know?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p>Wamby shook his head. “I am doubtful
about that Smithkin. I don’t know whether
to trust him or not.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he smells a rat?” queried
Harry.</p>

<p>“Think he does what?”</p>

<p>“Suspects—mistrusts something,” explained
Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Wamby. “Yes, I do. You see,
he knows well enough that the King would never
release all these elves from the mines, and ever
since we came back he has been casting suspicious
glances at us, as if he were trying to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
out what we were about. He’s a treacherous
fellow. I’m afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Harry, “don’t tell him anything.
Wait until we get arms for all these
fellows, and we can defy those fifty
soldiers.”</p>

<p>“But the trouble is,” observed Wamby,
“that Smithkin is the only one who knows the
way back, and where the armory is.”</p>

<p>Harry pondered a moment. “It seems to
me the best plan is this,” said he. “You order
Smithkin to lead us to the King. You, Kitey,
and I will go ahead with Smithkin, the released
elves will come next, and the soldiers bring up
the rear. Then Smithkin can’t communicate
with his men, and we can watch him closely,
and easily disarm and bind him at the least sign
of treachery.”</p>

<p>The plan impressed Wamby favorably.
He gave orders to that effect, and they
were soon hastening on the way to the Grand
Royal Reception Hall. They traversed a
number of passages, and climbed many long
flights of steps. All went well for a
time. Although Smithkin was glum and
sullen, he certainly was leading them in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
right direction, and they saw no reason to
suspect him.</p>

<p>At length they came to a place where the
passageway expanded into a long and rather
narrow room. When they reached the further
end of the room, Smithkin examined the wall
closely, and then a disconcerted look came into
his face.</p>

<p>“I can’t find any door here,” said he. “One
of my men knows where it is, though; I’ll
go back and ask him.”</p>

<p>Harry followed him through the throng to
the other end of the room. All of the released
elves were in the room, but the soldiers had
halted in the passageway. Calling one of them
to him, Smithkin asked, “Where is the lower
door?”</p>

<p>“There is the place,” replied the soldier,
pointing to the wall on one side of the passageway
behind where Harry was standing.</p>

<p>Smithkin drew forth a pin, and said to Harry,
“Will your honor please step aside a moment?”</p>

<p>Harry drew back a few steps into the room;
thus there was no one in the passageway but
the soldiers. As soon as Harry was well in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the room, Smithkin inserted the pin in a hole,
pressed upon it thrice, and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pin, pin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Let them in;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Open the door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Open the <em>floor</em>!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Instantly the whole floor of the room swung
downwards, like an immense trap-door, and
dumped all but the soldiers upon a slippery
incline below. Away they went, sliding and
rolling and tumbling over one another, until
they landed in a confused heap at the bottom.
Then the trap-door swung shut, and left them
in darkness.</p>

<p>Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt, though
a number of them were bruised and scratched
considerably. After order was restored Harry
and Wamby talked over the situation, and came
to the conclusion that this room and trap-door
were mainly intended to prevent the Gnomes
from ever invading the domains of the Pin
Elves; and that Smithkin, suspecting all was
not right, made up his mind it would be a good
plan to imprison them until he could find out
from the King the real state of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“We are literally caught in a trap,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>Just then one of the elves exclaimed, “I’ve
found a little box on the floor.”</p>

<p>“Bring it here!” shouted Wamby. “It’s my
lantern-box. It flew out of my hands when I
fell.”</p>

<p>The light thus found cheered their spirits
not a little. They could see that they were in
a large chamber, with apparently no other mode
of exit than the way by which they had entered.</p>

<p>“There must be some way to get out,” said
Wamby. “You fellows sound the floor and
walls, and see if you cannot discover a door
somewhere.”</p>

<p>But their search proved vain. Not a sign of
a door was to be found, though they examined
carefully every square inch of the floor and of
the walls, as high up as they could reach.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing for us to do, then,” said
Wamby, “but wait and see what will happen.”</p>

<p>And wait they did, for some time, and then
what happened was the most unlooked-for thing
that could possibly occur. The trap-door above
opened an instant; there was a sound of mocking
laughter, the door closed again, and a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
after Smithkin himself came sliding and
rolling down the hill of glass, and landed in a
heap in the centre of the room.</p>

<p>Such a crushed and crestfallen Smithkin as
he was! They gathered about him and asked
what was the matter.</p>

<p>“Matter!” growled the discomfited soldier,
rising and stamping his foot in a rage, “mutiny
is the matter! Rebellion is the matter!
My soldiers have defied me. The King shall
know of it, and every one of them shall be sent
to the Gnomes!”</p>

<p>“Here, leave him to me,” said Wamby, taking
Smithkin by the arm and drawing him
aside.</p>

<p>After a long talk with him, Wamby returned to
the others, and said, “He has had some trouble
with his men, and they dumped him down here
out of revenge. But it will turn out to our
advantage, for he knows where the door is that
leads out of this hole. Give me your pin,
Harry. Smithkin’s is in possession of the soldiers
above.”</p>

<p>Harry drew a pin from the lapel of his coat
and handed it to him. “Now show me the
place,” said Wamby. Smithkin led him to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
foot of the hill of glass, and pointed to a little
pin-hole in the incline, about a foot from the
bottom.</p>

<p>“Well!” muttered Wamby, “no wonder we
couldn’t find it! Who would ever think of
looking for a door there?”</p>

<p>He inserted the pin, and pressing upon it
thrice, repeated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Pin, pin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trusty and stout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">We are within</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And want to get out.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But no door opened. Again he pressed the
pin and repeated the words, and again there
was no response.</p>

<p>“Are those the right words for this door,
Smithkin?” he asked of the soldier.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Smithkin; “try again.”</p>

<p>He did so a number of times, but all in vain.
At last he turned to Smithkin with a suspicious
look, and cried, “You are deceiving us, you
villain!”</p>

<p>The other elves began to gather around the
unfortunate soldier, with menacing looks and
muttered threats of vengeance, but he protested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
that he told the truth. “The door is
there, for I have seen it opened,” he said.
“Something must be wrong.”</p>

<p>Wamby thereupon drew forth the pin, and
after one glance at it, said to Harry, “Why,
you gave me a common pin!”</p>

<p>“Won’t it do?” asked Harry; “what difference
does it make?”</p>

<p>“A great deal,” answered Wamby; “only
a door-pin, made for the purpose, will open
doors. Why need I ask for <em>your</em> pin, if any
common one will do? And how do you suppose
it would be possible to keep any Pin Elf
in prison, when each one’s clothes are fastened
on with dozens of common pins?”</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” replied Harry; “I never
thought of that.”</p>

<p>He searched one lapel of his coat, and then
the other, and then looked at Wamby with a
blank countenance, and said, “The door-pin
is gone!”</p>

<p>“Gone!” cried Wamby, as a look of despair
settled on his face; “then we are lost!”</p>

<p>He was silent a moment. Then he smote
his little hands wildly together, and cried, “It’s
the work of some of those mean, ugly, thievish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
tricky Gnomes! They must have taken the
pin when you left your coat in the boat.” He
suddenly felt in his belt, and said to Harry in
a hoarse whisper, “They have stolen the hat-pin
also!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="fs80">THE TABLES TURNED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Look here, Wamby,” said Harry, “don’t
get excited. Let’s talk over the matter. There
must be some way for us to get out.”</p>

<p>Wamby shook his head disconsolately.</p>

<p>“Maybe the soldiers can help us,” Harry
went on. “They are able to open the door
above; couldn’t we induce them to get ropes
and draw us out?”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t possible,” replied Wamby. “In the
first place, we can’t communicate with them
unless they open the trap-door, and you must
remember that they are afraid of us as well as
of Smithkin, for they consented to our being
dumped down here; then again, even if they
were willing to draw us out, how could they get
the rope necessary? Certainly, they wouldn’t
dare go near the King, after having let us
escape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Just then there was a loud shriek from one
of the elves at the other end of the room, followed
by a chorus of shrill, elfish laughter.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Wamby rather
sternly.</p>

<p>“Kitey sat down on a pin,” was the reply,
“and he jumped up at least a foot high.”</p>

<p>Kitey was seen rubbing himself and examining
the skirt of his jacket, and then suddenly
he uttered a surprised exclamation and ran up
to Wamby.</p>

<p>“Here’s the door-pin!” he cried; “it was
sticking in my coat.”</p>

<p>“How did it get there?” demanded Wamby.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Harry, “when we tumbled
down here it got loose and stuck in Kitey’s
jacket. I remember now, I fell on top of
Kitey.”</p>

<p>Wamby eagerly seized the pin, and putting it
in the hole, pressed upon it and repeated the
usual words. The door opened and revealed a
flight of steps immediately under the incline.
They ascended these, and at the top Smithkin
showed them a door through which they
emerged in the passageway near where the
soldiers were. At sight of them the soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
scampered into the room containing the trap-door.</p>

<p>Wamby’s quick eye noted that they had neglected
to remove Smithkin’s door-pin from the
hole, so he ran up, and placing his finger on
the head of the pin, shouted “Surrender instantly,
or I’ll dump you all down below! Lay
down your arms and walk out here, and I’ll
promise to treat you well.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image053" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image053.jpg" alt="Boy kneeling">
</figure>

<p>Without hesitation the scared soldiers dropped
their spears, and hurried out into the passageway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“Now,” said Wamby, drawing forth the pin,
“Kitey, you take fifty of our men and arm
them with those spears, and keep guard over
these soldiers.”</p>

<p>Then Wamby nodded to Harry, who in a
second seized Smithkin, took away his spear,
and held him fast while two of the elves bound
his hands behind him.</p>

<p>“Guard him closely, and keep him separate
from the rest,” ordered Wamby.</p>

<p>After Smithkin had been removed to a distance,
Wamby turned to the disarmed soldiers
and said, “Do any of you know where the
royal armory is?”</p>

<p>“Smithkin is the only one who knows,” one
of the men replied. “We common soldiers
were never allowed to go to the armory.”</p>

<p>Wamby beckoned Harry aside, and whispered,
“What can we do now? It seems
impossible to arm the rest of our men.”</p>

<p>“I have a scheme that may answer,” said
Harry. And he whispered the scheme in Wamby’s
ear.</p>

<p>Wamby pondered a minute. “It’s very bold,”
he said, “but it strikes me as the only course
open to us. Let us try it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>Then, returning and addressing the soldiers:
“Do you fellows know the way to the Grand
Royal Reception Hall?”</p>

<p>The soldiers consulted together a moment,
and then one of them stepped forward, and
answered, “I know the way.”</p>

<p>“I want you to lead us there,” said Wamby.
“If we succeed in what we are about to attempt,
I promise that each one of you fifty will
be well rewarded. If we fail, you will be no
worse off than you are now. Will you conduct
us?”</p>

<p>The spokesman nodded, and answered boldly,
“We will. We are under your orders.”</p>

<p>They forthwith proceeded under the guidance
of the spokesman, and soon came to a
large chamber, somewhat broader than the one
containing the trap-door. Here the soldier
stopped, and pointing to a passageway at the
other end of the chamber, said in a low tone,
“The Hall is at the end of that short passageway.
The door is the one you may have
seen on the left of the King, near the throne.
There are two soldiers guarding the door, but
if you will permit one of my companions and
myself to go to them alone, I think we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
entice them to this room, and you can capture
them.”</p>

<p>Wamby looked at him sharply. “I’ll trust
you,” said he; “take a man with you, and go.”</p>

<p>When they had gone, Wamby ordered the
elves to stand along the walls so as not to be
seen by any one in the passageway, and then
he placed his fifty armed men on each side
of the entrance.</p>

<p>After a little silent waiting, the two soldiers
came running into the chamber, followed closely
by the two guards. The latter of course were
speedily captured, disarmed, and bound.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Wamby to his armed followers,
“you men remain concealed as before on each
side of this entrance, and await further orders.
And the rest of you keep where you can’t be
seen from the passageway.”</p>

<p>Beckoning to Harry, he entered the passageway
and came to the door at the end.</p>

<p>“First let us take a peep,” said he; and
opening the door on a crack, they looked out
into the Reception Hall.</p>

<p>After the door closed, Harry whispered,
“There are only a few of the body-guard there.
No doubt the King has heard of our escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
from the prison, and sent most of his soldiers
to find us. Are you all ready? Be sure to
shut the door after I come out, and keep it
shut as long as you can. I am ready.”</p>

<p>Wamby pressed upon the pin, and the door
swung open. With a yell loud enough to scare
a thousand elves, Harry dashed up to the
throne, picked the little King up bodily, and
rushed back through the doorway before any
of the soldiers had a chance to touch him.
Without stopping he ran on to the chamber,
and laying the King down, called out, “Here,
some of you fellows, come and help me!”
For by this time the King was struggling,
scratching, and biting like a vicious cat.</p>

<p>But not an elf moved. They simply looked
on in amazement and fear.</p>

<p>“Afraid, eh?” cried Harry. “Well, perhaps
you’d better not have a hand in it.”</p>

<p>Placing one knee on the King’s body, he
drew forth the royal hat-pin and stuck it in
his own coat. Then he took off the crown
and placed it over Wamby’s hat on top of his
own head, and loosing the royal mantle, pinned
it over his own shoulders.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, springing up, “<em>I</em> am king.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Take that fellow and bind him. Don’t hurt
him, though,” he cried, as he saw the vengeful,
angry looks with which the elves rushed upon
their disrobed tyrant. “Any one that injures
him will be sent back to the Gnomes. He’ll
be punished in due time. You men that are
armed, follow me to relieve Wamby.”</p>

<p>They were just in time; for, notwithstanding
Wamby’s efforts, the door was being gradually
forced open by the ex-King’s body-guard.</p>

<p>“Let ’em come, Wamby!” shouted Harry.</p>

<p>As the door flew open, Harry stepped forward
with a stern, commanding look, and held
up the royal hat-pin. The soldiers stopped,
looked in bewilderment at the crown on his
head, and then bowed low to the floor.</p>

<p>“Drop your spears! Rise! March into that
chamber!” cried Harry. The terrified soldiers
instantly obeyed. “Kitey,” called Harry, “have
some of our men arm themselves with those
spears, and follow me.”</p>

<p>By this time a large crowd of the elves in
the Hall had gathered about the doorway.</p>

<p>“Clear the way to my throne,” commanded
Harry, addressing his fifty armed men. “Come,
Wamby,” he continued, and marching solemnly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
forward, he ascended the steps to the throne
and seated himself, motioning Wamby to a seat
on his right, and Kitey to one on his left.</p>

<p>“Now,” began Harry,—and then he suddenly
stopped and glared at Wamby, whose
face showed an almost irresistible tendency to
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“What are you grinning at?” demanded
Harry sternly.</p>

<p>“Please excuse me, master,” said Wamby;
“but you do look awfully funny!”</p>

<p>He certainly did look comical. The King’s
mantle was like a little baby’s cape on his
shoulders, and the collar of it would not reach
half-way around his neck. Wamby’s pointed
hat was so small that it simply perched on
top of his head. And the crown, with the
hat poking through it, while it was very beautiful,
with its gold and diamonds and rubies, yet
looked like some little toy crown.</p>

<p>As Harry thought of it all, he nearly burst
out laughing himself, especially when he noticed
how solemnly he was holding up that ridiculous
hat-pin sceptre. But of course he realized that
it would never do to laugh as long as he was
king, so he frowned very hard at Wamby, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
said in a solemn tone, to one of his fifty armed
men, “Cause all of the Pin Elves to assemble
in my presence. Take some soldiers with you
and bring hither also the former King and
Smithkin.”</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Harry, when this had
been done, “let us proceed to business.”</p>

<p>But before he had a chance to say more,
there was a loud knock on the outside of the
door by which they had come in, and, as if
in answer to it, another loud knock was heard
on a door at the opposite side of the Hall.</p>

<p>Harry leaned over towards Wamby, and
whispered, “What does that mean?”</p>

<p>Wamby shook his head seriously, and replied,
“I don’t know.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="fs80">A NEW KING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Everybody looked at everybody else, and
then all looked at Harry, as if to say, “What
shall we do?”</p>

<p>Harry pondered a minute, and finally ordered
a troop of his armed men to proceed to the
nearest door first, and see who was there.
They did so, and soon returned, followed by a
large number of the ex-King’s body-guard. The
soldiers looked much bewildered at seeing Harry
on the throne, but as he held up the sceptre
they all bowed very low before him.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” demanded Harry.</p>

<p>The leader bowed low again, and answered,
“If it please Your Royal Majesty, we were sent
by the King—that is, by the <em>former</em> King—to
look for you and Wamby.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harry, “you have found us, so you
may go and stand along the wall over there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>The soldiers obeyed, and ranged themselves
along the wall like a lot of naughty schoolboys.</p>

<p>The other door being opened, a second body
of soldiers entered, and were ordered to stand
along the opposite wall.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Harry, “let us again proceed
to business. Bring the ex-King before me.”</p>

<p>When the former King was brought, Harry
proceeded: “You are charged with being a
tyrant. You have unlawfully punished over a
thousand of your subjects, and have been a bad
fellow in other ways, so I hear. Have you anything
to answer?”</p>

<p>The deposed monarch looked sullen, and
made no reply.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harry, “I’ll put it to a vote.
All who know that the charges against the ex-King
are true, please say ‘aye.’”</p>

<p>A perfect chorus of “ayes” rang through the
Hall.</p>

<p>“Now, all who believe the charges are false,
say ‘no,’” continued Harry.</p>

<p>“No!” yelled the Lord of the Safety-Pin.</p>

<p>“You’re a prisoner yourself and haven’t any
right to vote,” said Harry. “Bring that fellow
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>The Lord of the Safety-Pin shook his little
fist at Harry, as he stood before him, and cried
out shrilly, “You are a common mortal, and
have no right to be our king! I hate you!
You stole my slave Wamby. I’m glad I stuck
you with a pin. ’Twas I had you and Wamby
arrested! ’Twas I—”</p>

<p>When he had gotten thus far, he choked and
spluttered with rage.</p>

<p>“Here!” cried Harry, “hand him up to
me!” Taking the vicious little fellow by the
collar, he laid him across his knee and gave him
a sound spanking, while the assembled elves
danced and shouted with delight.</p>

<p>“Take from him all his safety-pins,” said
Harry, “and give them to Wamby, who will divide
them among the most worthy of the esquires
and retainers of the Safety-Pin Order.
Then shut up the fellow in prison for two
months, and after that let him begin over again
as a common Pin Elf.”</p>

<p>“And now,” went on Harry, “for the third
time, let us dispose of the ex-King. Which one
of you elves has been down with the Gnomes
the longest?”</p>

<p>Kitey arose and said, “If it please Your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Royal Majesty, I have; fifteen years ago, as you
mortals count time, was I banished to the mines.”</p>

<p>“Is that correct according to records?”
Harry asked of the Grand Royal Recorder.</p>

<p>“If it please Your Royal Majesty, it is correct,”
responded that individual.</p>

<p>“Then listen to my sentence,” said Harry.
“The ex-King is to be sent to the Gnomes to
work in the mines for fifteen years. After that
he is to become a retainer in the Order of the
Hat-Pin, with a chance to work his way up, if
he behaves himself. If any of you object to
the sentence, don’t be afraid to speak out.”
For he noticed that many of the elves looked
dissatisfied.</p>

<p>“The sentence is too light,” cried a number
of voices.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harry, “we mustn’t be too
hard. Since I have been king I can see how
easy it is to be tyrannical.</p>

<p>“Now bring Smithkin here. Smithkin, I
forgive you. You were faithful to your former
master, be just as faithful to your new king.
But you must begin over again as a common
soldier, so that by obedience you may learn
better how to command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“As for you fifty soldiers who led us hither,
each one of you is hereby appointed an officer
over fifty men.</p>

<p>“The elves who have been in the mines are
to take the positions they had before they were
banished.</p>

<p>“Have you all those orders written down
in the records?” he demanded of the Grand
Recorder.</p>

<p>“I have, Your Majesty,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Kitey,” continued Harry, “I appoint you
Grand Royal Prime Minister. Get up, Wamby,
and give him that seat at my right.”</p>

<p>Wamby complied, but his face wore a disappointed
and grieved look, as if he thought it
hardly fair for Harry to pass by him and give
to Kitey the place of honor.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Harry, “I am going to abdicate,
and you must elect a new king.”</p>

<p>So saying, he attempted to rise, but found
himself unable to do so. The throne was made
for a Pin Elf, not for a good-sized boy, and it
was so small that Harry had become wedged
fast. The elves perceived at once what the
trouble was, and forgetting all fear and decorum,
laughed and danced about with glee, shouting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
“You’ve got to stay on the throne! You can’t
get away! You’ll have to be our king always!”</p>

<p>But after tugging away until he grew red in
the face, Harry managed to wriggle loose and
stand up.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he cried; “you must have a Pin
Elf for your King. I have been here a long
time, and want to go home; my folks will be
very anxious about me. I nominate Wamby as
king,—all who are in favor of the nomination
say ‘aye.’”</p>

<p>The elves saw that Harry meant it, and all
shouted “aye” lustily.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Wamby,” said Harry. For little
Wamby was standing in open-mouthed wonder,
and seemed hardly to understand what was
being done. Harry handed him the hat-pin,
and put on him the crown and royal mantle.</p>

<p>“Do you all promise to be faithful to Wamby,
and obey him as long as he is a good king?”
cried Harry.</p>

<p>“We do,” was the unanimous response.</p>

<p>“Now, Wamby, stand up,” said Harry. “Do
you promise to be a good, kind king, and to rule
according to the laws?”</p>

<p>“I do,” replied Wamby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“Everything is settled, then,” said Harry,
stepping down from the dais; “so, wishing you
all good luck and good-by, I’ll go. Good-by,
Wamby. Here’s your hat.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” said Wamby; and turning
to the crowd of elves, he addressed them as follows:
“Fellow Pin Elves, although Harry refuses
to remain king over us, a position he well
deserves, I feel sure he will not decline election as a
prince of the royal family of Hat-Pins.” This
suggestion met with great approval, and Harry was
unanimously elected a Prince of the Hat-Pins,
with all the rights and privileges of the order.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was over, Harry once
more said good-by to all the elves. He took
off Wamby’s hat, but as soon as it was removed,
Pin Elves and throne and everything
disappeared, and he was standing in a bare,
empty room.</p>

<p>“This won’t do,” he cried. “I must keep
the hat on till I get above ground.” And he
clapped it on top of his head again, when instantly
everything became once more visible.</p>

<p>“We’ll all accompany you to the entrance,”
said Wamby.</p>

<p>So off they went in grand style, Wamby and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Harry ahead, with Kitey on one side, and on
the other side the Grand Royal Recorder, an
old, withered elf, with large, gold-bowed spectacles
perched on his sharp nose, and a big pen
behind his ear; then came some of the soldiers;
next, the lords, with their knights and
esquires; then more soldiers, and in the rear a
large multitude of the ordinary elves.</p>

<p>Finally they reached the chamber with the
trap-door that opened into Central Park. Wamby
and Kitey, with a number of others, ascended
the steps with Harry. When they reached the
top, Harry turned and waved good-by to the
elves below.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Wamby, “I’ve forgotten something.
Where is the Grand Royal Treasurer?”</p>

<p>A tall elf, with a pouch hanging at his side,
stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Have you jewels in your pouch?” inquired
Wamby.</p>

<p>“I have, Your Majesty,” replied the Treasurer,
and he opened the pouch.</p>

<p>Harry looked, and rubbed his eyes in amazement,
for the pouch was crammed full of flashing
and sparkling diamonds, rubies, and emeralds
of immense size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Wamby smiled at the expression on Harry’s
face. “Help yourself, Prince,” said he. “Keep
them as a slight token of my gratitude.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want them all,” said Harry. “One
of them alone is worth a fortune. I shall just
take one of each kind, and thank you, old chap,”
and selecting three of the precious stones, he
slipped them into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Here is your door-pin,” said Wamby. “I
shall be glad to have you come down again at
any time. Will you promise to come if I ever
need you?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“Then listen,” said Wamby; “if you should
see a little green twig sticking in the pin-hole
in the centre of this rock, it will be a sign that
I want you. Now let me see if the coast is
clear.”</p>

<p>Inserting his own door-pin in the hole overhead,
he repeated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Pin, pin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trusty and stout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">I am within</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And want to look out.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“All right,” he said, as he glanced through
the crack of the door; “no one is near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
rock. But a Park policeman is coming in the
distance, so we must hurry.”</p>

<p>Harry hastily snatched off Wamby’s hat, and
holding it out felt Wamby take it. Of course the
elves became invisible the instant the hat was off.
Then the door opened, and Harry felt his legs
grasped by a number of elfish hands, and he
was lifted up bodily and tossed through the
opening so violently that he rolled off the rock
upon the grass.</p>

<p>When he jumped up, he was sure he heard
Wamby’s voice, shouting, “Good-by, Prince
Harry!” and it seemed to him that he could see
the trap-door just settling into place. But as
the Park policeman came up at that moment,
he looked away from the rock and began brushing
the dust from his clothes. When he reached
his room at home, he put the wonderful door-pin,
with the jewels Wamby had given him,
carefully in a little box. “I have had some surprising
adventures,” he thought, “and, at any
rate, I have given the Pin Elves a good king.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="fs80">THE PASSAGE OF THE TOAD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A few weeks later Harry went to the Park
again. When he came to the rock he saw a
little green twig sticking in the pin-hole.</p>

<p>“Halloa!” he cried. “Has Wamby got into
trouble already? I hope he hasn’t been playing
the tyrant himself. Well, at any rate, I
must help him, as I promised to do.”</p>

<p>He had neglected to bring the door-pin with
him, so he hastened back to get it.</p>

<p>“What else can I take?” he said to himself.
“I wish I had a weapon of some kind.”</p>

<p>The nearest approach to a weapon that he
could find, however, was simply a little pop-gun,
or pop-pistol rather, belonging to his younger
brother, and a steel paper-cutter shaped like a
knife. These he slipped into his pockets, and
then hurried back to the rock in the Park.</p>

<p>The chamber beneath the trap-door was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
vacant when he descended into it. Knowing
that extreme wariness and caution were necessary,
he examined every part of the chamber
carefully before proceeding further, and was
rewarded by the discovery of an elfin hat thrust
into a crevice of the rock about the height of
his head from the floor.</p>

<p>“It looks like Wamby’s,” he said, putting
the hat on his head. “The little chap must
have placed it here for me.”</p>

<p>He went forward cautiously, without seeing
anything amiss until he drew near to the door
where the two guards were stationed, when
suddenly he stopped and uttered an exclamation
of dismay; for there, guarding the door, stood
two tall, hideous Gnomes. The reason they
had not noticed him was because just at that
moment they were occupied in opening the
door.</p>

<p>Harry stood rooted to the spot in amazement
for an instant. But when the door opened and
showed him a large troop of armed Gnomes
coming through it towards him, he regained
control of himself quickly enough, and turned
and ran back along the passageway at full
speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The Gnomes at once caught sight of him
and started in hot pursuit. Harry was fleet-footed,
but he soon discovered that Gnomes are
terrible fellows in a race, and that his pursuers
were slowly gaining upon him.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill of glass was the
entrance to a side-passage. Into this the boy
dashed, and a short distance further dodged
into a cross-passage, along which he had run
but a few paces when he stumbled and fell
across an open trap-door in the floor. Luckily,
the opening was small, or he would surely have
plunged down head foremost to destruction.</p>

<p>His pursuers were out of sight, and scarcely
knowing what he was doing, he sprang through
the trap-door, and pushing the door up into
place, crouched upon the steps beneath it. A
moment later he could hear the troop of Gnomes
rushing along the passage just above his head.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” he chuckled to himself. “Trot
along, my boys,—but you’ll have a hard time
finding me!”</p>

<p>When he had recovered his breath, he felt
his way down to the bottom of the stone steps,
and began slowly creeping forward.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this,” he muttered. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
place was pitch-dark. “I’m liable to tumble
into some pitfall, or maybe slide head first down
one of those beastly hills of glass.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to do, though, but feel his
way along in a very stealthy, uncanny fashion
that made the cold creeps course up and down
his backbone.</p>

<p>“Gracious! this is perfectly awful!” he
exclaimed, as his hand touched a specially
cold spot on the rock, that felt like something
slimy and alive. “I thought it was a snail, or
something!”</p>

<p>He stopped, and wiped the cold perspiration
from his forehead.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” he continued, “what a big fool
I am! Afraid of the dark! I’m a brave one
to rescue Wamby!” and mustering up courage,
he went on more boldly.</p>

<p>Presently a faint light appeared in the distance
ahead, causing him to renew his wariness
and slacken his pace. As he softly advanced,
he descried an elf sitting in the passage, with
a lantern-box on the floor beside him. Harry
hesitated an instant, but thinking he had nothing
to fear from one Pin Elf, he advanced openly.
Upon hearing the footsteps the elf immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
shut his lantern-box, but as he leaned over to do
so, the light flashed in his face brightly, and
showed Harry that it was his old friend Kitey.</p>

<p>“Halloa, Kitey, old fellow, what are you
doing here?” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>“Is it you, Prince Harry?” said Kitey, in
a tone of delight; and opening his lantern-box
again, he ran forward and embraced Harry’s
feet.</p>

<p>“Why, little chap, what’s the trouble?”
inquired the boy.</p>

<p>“How did you get down here?” asked the
elf in return. “Don’t talk loud, or we may be
overheard.”</p>

<p>In a few words Harry related his escape from
the Gnomes.</p>

<p>“So I left that trap-door open in my hurry!”
said Kitey, at the conclusion of the narrative.
“It is lucky you found it, instead of those rascally
Gnomes.”</p>

<p>“But what are the Gnomes doing here?”
asked Harry; “and why are you hiding? and
what has become of Wamby?”</p>

<p>“Sit down, Prince, and I will tell you all
about it,” said Kitey. “After you left us
everything went along nicely for awhile. Cattisack,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the ex-King, was sent down to the Gnomes,
and old Grumpy, the Lord of the Safety-Pin,
was imprisoned. But Grumpy, the old sneak,
behaved so nicely that Wamby felt sorry for
him, and set him free, and restored him to his
former position. That was the real beginning
of the mischief.</p>

<p>“Old Grumpy immediately began secretly
forming a party against Wamby, and was almost
ready to begin a rebellion, when Wamby discovered
the plot, and sent Grumpy to the
Gnomes. That was the second blunder.</p>

<p>“Soon after that, Wamby took it into his
head that the soldiers needed another commander,
and as Smithkin was experienced, and
had been behaving beautifully, he reinstated
him in his old position. That was the third
blunder.</p>

<p>“Of course, Prince Harry, you know I am
not blaming King Wamby,—at the time we
all thought he was doing just right; but it
seems he wasn’t, for Cattisack and Grumpy
at once began plotting with the King of the
Gnomes, and out of revenge offered to deliver
to him the Pin Elf dominions. They both
knew all the secret passageways, and how many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
soldiers we had, and where the guards were
stationed, and so it was very easy for them to
lead the whole army of the Gnomes right to the
Grand Royal Reception Hall.</p>

<p>“It all happened yesterday. Wamby was
sitting on his throne holding a reception, and
I was seated on his right. All of a sudden the
door to the left of the throne opened a little,
and then closed again. It was done quickly
and quietly, but I was looking in that direction
and saw through the doorway a Gnome’s ugly
face. Instantly surmising that something was
wrong, I darted forward and slipped all the
bolts in the door. That made the door impregnable
against any assault of the Gnomes, and
we should have been safe, had it not been for
that Smithkin. He must have been in collusion
with Cattisack, for no sooner had I secured
the door than Smithkin ran thither, dashed me
aside, undid the bolts, and admitted the Gnoman
army.</p>

<p>“Even then we could easily have held our
own and driven them back, for, you know, one
Pin Elf is equal to three Gnomes, because we
are so quick and active, and they are so slow
and heavy; but some of the Safety-Pin men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
rallied around old Grumpy, and at least half
of the body-guard went over to Smithkin, and
as the rest of us were entirely unprepared they
soon got the better of us.</p>

<p>“Seeing that all was lost, Wamby whispered
to me, ‘Quick, Kitey! while there is a chance,
run up to the rock in Central Park and stick
a little green twig in the pin-hole, as a signal
to our good Prince Harry; and put my hat in
the chamber, where he can find it.’</p>

<p>“Fortunately, in the excitement of the conflict,
the Gnomes had neglected to guard any
of the doors, and I escaped without being seen,
and placed the green twig in the hole. On my
return, however, I discovered six Gnomes on
guard outside the door, so I quietly retreated
and made my way down here, where I have
been ever since.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t we in danger of being discovered
here?” inquired Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Prince,” replied Kitey; “no one
would dare come here. This is the terrible
Passage of the Toad.”</p>

<p>“Passage of the Toad!” repeated Harry.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Kitey, “this passage was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
constructed ages ago, as a secret means of
escape, in case our dominions should be invaded.
It leads from the Grand Reception
Hall, and branches off into several small passageways,
and we are in one of those smaller,
branching passageways. But just as the whole
thing was completed, a toad made its appearance
in the main passage. Of course the entrances
were at once closed, and no one ever
after ventured to enter. It was only necessity
that drove me hither.”</p>

<p>“But, Kitey, I don’t understand you. How
could a toad get in the passage? and if he did
get in, what difference did it make?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how he got in,” replied
Kitey, “but he certainly was there, and doubtless
is there to this day. And you ask, what
difference does it make? Why, don’t you know
that elves cannot bear the contact, or even the
near presence, of a toad? It prostrates us completely.
So there was nothing for us to do but
shut up the passage, which has been called by
us ever since the Passage of the Toad. Evidently,
the horrible creature is not near this
branch passage where we are now, or I should
hardly have been able to come down here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“Well, never mind the toad at present,” said
Harry. “What do you suppose has become of
Wamby and the rest of the Pin Elves?”</p>

<p>“I think they have been sent down to work
in the mines, and the Gnomes have taken possession
of our kingdom,” answered Kitey.</p>

<p>“In other words,” said Harry, “the Gnomes
are on top, and the Pin Elves down below. The
wicked elves have ousted the good elves and
made slaves of them.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” replied Kitey. “That is what
I believe has taken place.” He sighed dolefully,
and continued: “Poor Wamby! I wish
we could help him. It is awful to have to work
down in Gnome Land. I was there, and know
all about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” exclaimed Harry eagerly; “I
suppose you know all about the ins and outs of
the place. Your knowledge may be a great
help to us if we go down to rescue our friends.
Meanwhile, I should like to know if they are
really there now, and whether the Gnomes are
in possession of our dominions.”</p>

<p>“You might find out, if you are not afraid of
the toad,” said Kitey. “This little passage will
lead you to the main passage, and if you follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
that to the end you will find a flight of steps
and a trap-door at the top of them opening into
the Reception Hall. The door opens in the floor
of the dais, just behind the throne. You can
take a peep through it and see what is taking
place in the Hall.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” cried Harry, springing up.
“Just lend me your lantern-box, so that I can
see my way.”</p>

<p>“One word, Prince, before you go,” said
Kitey. “Find out where the toad is, and
please keep him away from this place. Above
all, do not touch him! for if you do, I cannot
endure your presence.”</p>

<p>“All right, old chap,” returned Harry, “I’ll
bear it in mind. Don’t you be afraid of Mr.
Toad! I’ll look after him, and will be back
here soon.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the main passage Harry found the toad, a
small and rather thin creature, not at all dangerous-looking.
As Harry held the light close to
it, the little animal blinked its eyes as though
half-blind, and seemed too dispirited to hop
away.</p>

<p>“Poor little hoppy!” said the boy; “I bet
you’re almost starved to death here. Never
mind! I’ll take you back on top of the earth
when I go.”</p>

<p>The toad was plainly in no condition to
travel as far as Kitey, so Harry let him remain
where he was, and went on to the end of the
passage and mounted the steps.</p>

<p>Kitey had directed him where to find the pin-hole
in the trap-door above, and when he had
inserted the pin, he shut the lantern-box, pressed
upon the pin three times, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">“Pin, pin,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The door opened slightly and he peeped
through, and seeing no one upon the dais, he
opened the door wide, and crawling through,
peered cautiously around the edge of the
throne.</p>

<p>The Hall was empty, and Harry’s first
thought was that perhaps he had lost the
elfin hat from his head, and therefore the Hall
only seemed empty. But the hat was still there
when he felt for it, so he quietly remained waiting
for some one to appear. After a time a
number of Gnomes entered, bearing dishes of
various kinds of food, which they deposited upon
a table near the throne. Then they all withdrew.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Harry darted forward, and
dumping the food from the dishes upon the
table-cloth, he gathered up the cloth by the
corners, and carried it with its savory contents
down through the trap-door to the passageway,
and then ran up the steps again to his hiding-place
behind the throne. Just as he reached
his position, two doors opened. Through one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
filed the servants who had set the table, and
through the other came the King of the Gnomes
with his attendants.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you can, how they all looked when
they beheld the empty table and the empty
dishes scattered around on the floor!</p>

<p>The servants were so astonished at the sudden
and mysterious disappearance of the food,
that they forgot even to make obeisance to the
King. As for the King, he became black in
the face with rage, and his terrible right eye
fairly flashed fire.</p>

<p>“Where are the viands?” he growled through
his bushy beard.</p>

<p>The Head Caterer, who had been staring
open-mouthed at the table, tremblingly prostrated
himself, and said, “If it please Your Royal
Majesty, the table was duly set anon, but the
viands have disappeared, I know not where.”</p>

<p>“Disappeared!” quoth the King; “how dare
you allow the royal victuals to disappear? Produce
more food at once!”</p>

<p>“I cannot, Your Majesty,” whimpered the
Caterer; “the cooking-fire has gone out.”</p>

<p>“Glumdozo!” roared the King in a mighty
voice, and every Gnome present trembled at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
sound of the word, which made Harry suppose
it was a terrible Gnoman oath. Thereupon the
King grasped his golden pickax by the handle,
and hurled it at the luckless Caterer.</p>

<p>Fortunately for himself the Caterer was peering
out of the corner of his eye, and adroitly
dodged the pickax, which bounded along the
floor and smashed a number of the rare and
costly dishes.</p>

<p>“Hummelskrash!” roared the King. “Take
the knave and his fellows to work in the mines
with the Pin Elves, and tell Wamby to assign
them the hottest and hardest work there.</p>

<p>The poor Caterer and the rest of the Gnomes
who had served the dinner were at once hustled
away, and the King, with his courtiers, approached
the dais. Harry waited long enough
only to see that Cattisack, Grumpy, and Smithkin
were among the King’s followers, and then
he retreated hurriedly through the trap-door and
made his way back to Kitey.</p>

<p>“Are you hungry, old chap?” were the first
words he uttered.</p>

<p>“Hungry!” exclaimed Kitey, “I’m nearly
starved!”</p>

<p>“Then let us fall to without delay,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Harry, opening the table-cloth and seating himself
on the floor beside it.</p>

<p>“Did you see the toad?” asked Kitey
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t worry about him, for he’s too
starved to hop far. I have found out the state
of affairs. The Gnomes have possession of our
dominions, and our people, all except Cattisack,
Grumpy, and Smithkin, and a few of their
adherents, are banished to the Gnomes’ old
quarters.”</p>

<p>Then he told Kitey all that had happened
during his absence. They both nearly choked
with suppressed laughter during the recital, but
at its conclusion Kitey grew very sober, and
said, “I wish we could help Wamby and the
others to escape.”</p>

<p>Harry was thoughtful a moment. “Where
do the rest of these branching passages lead?”
said he.</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried Kitey excitedly. “If
that horrible toad would keep out of the way,
I could take you to one passage that leads in
the right direction.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Harry, “I’ll attend to the
toad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Tearing off a small piece of the table-cloth, he
continued, “I’ll tie him up in this piece, and
while I am gone you can wrap up the rest of
the food in the table-cloth for us to take with us.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image089" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image089.jpg" alt="Boy on one knee">
</figure>

<p>Proceeding to where the toad was, Harry
made a little bag of the piece of cloth and
gently tied the animal in it.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to do it, hoppy,” he said; “but if
you’ll only be quiet a little while, I’ll take you
out of this hole when I go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>When he came back, Kitey was awaiting him
with the food tied up. Shouldering the bundle,
Harry followed the elf to the main passage, and
thence to one of the other smaller passages
branching off. This they followed for a distance
till they came to a long, descending
stairway, at the bottom of which was a door.
Opening the door, Kitey held aloft his light.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s an underground river!” Harry
exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>And so it was, a gently flowing stream of
water, so clear and limpid that one could see
plainly the smooth, rocky bottom. The stream
was about forty feet wide, and the roof of the
tunnel through which it flowed was perhaps
fifteen or twenty feet high above the surface
of the water.</p>

<p>“Where does it come from?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Kitey replied. “It must
come from above ground somewhere. But,
although I don’t know exactly where the
stream comes from, I can tell you where it
goes, and that is straight to the lake that
you crossed when you went to the country
of the Gnomes. Can’t we go this way to see
Wamby and help him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps,” Harry said, glancing about. “Is
there a boat here?”</p>

<p>“None that I know of,” said Kitey; “but I
am sure, Prince, that you can devise some way
of getting there without a boat.”</p>

<p>Harry pondered for several minutes. “A
raft would answer the purpose, if we only had
something to make it of. I say, Kitey, give
me that lantern, and you wait here till I come
back.” And he hurried up the passage.</p>

<p>Not long after, Kitey beheld him returning
down the long stairway with a low, broad table
on his back.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” exclaimed the elf.</p>

<p>“In the Reception Hall,” the boy replied, as
he deposited his burden on the floor. “The
Hall was empty, and it was the only thing I
could find that might do. I broke one of the
other tables and brought these two pieces of
board to steer with. What fun it would be to
see the old King when he discovers it! I bet
he’ll say something worse than ‘hummyslash!’
or whatever the word is. Now, old man, let
me slide this thing into the water.” And turning
the table bottom side up, he carefully
launched it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“Tight as a drum, and floats like a cork!”
he cried delightedly. “Let me try my weight
upon it. All right! it bears beautifully. I’ll
put the food in the bow, and you can sit in the
stern, and steer with that short piece of board;
and I’ll sit in the middle and use that longer
board, to keep the craft from turning around
or running against the sides of the tunnel. All
aboard! Off we go, then!”</p>

<p>The little lantern-box had been tied to one of
the front table-legs in such a way as to keep the
light from shining in their eyes and yet light up
the tunnel ahead of them. The only trouble
they had was to keep their improvised boat from
drifting sidewise; but a little practice enabled
them to overcome that tendency, and they were
soon floating easily and gently down the stream.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this jolly!” exclaimed Harry. “We’re
running along at a good pace now, you can tell
by looking at the sides of the tunnel.”</p>

<p>“Our speed has been increasing a great deal
for the last few moments,” said Kitey. “You
know we moved quite slowly when we started.
Listen, Prince! do you hear anything?”</p>

<p>“I hear nothing unusual,” replied Harry,
putting his hand to his ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“Listen again!” said Kitey; “it is growing
louder every second.”</p>

<p>Harry did so. “Why,” said he, “it seems
to me I do hear some kind of a noise ahead.
A kind of a roaring sound. Say, Kitey, old
man, it sounds like a waterfall!”</p>

<p>By this time they were being carried along
at a terrific pace, but the water was smooth
and glassy, with only an occasional ripple to
indicate how rapidly it was gliding downward.</p>

<p>The elf sprang to his feet and peered forward.
“There are rapids ahead. I can see
the foam and waves. Here they are! Quick,
Prince, hold on for your life!” and he crouched
down and grasped the edge of the table.</p>

<p>Harry threw down his piece of board and
clutched a table-leg, and so they hung on for
dear life, expecting every moment to be dashed
over a waterfall, or to be spilled out in the
boiling and foaming waters. But their stanch
little craft kept right side up in fine shape,
although it behaved very queerly otherwise.
Sometimes it bobbed along sideways, sometimes
it dashed forward stern foremost; once
it struck an eddy, and began spinning around
till they grew dizzy; once it slid upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
back of a partially submerged rock, stuck there
a moment, and then plunged forward, splashing
them from head to foot.</p>

<p>But no waterfall appeared, and gradually the
water grew quieter, and they were floating tranquilly
along out of danger.</p>

<p>“Tell you what it is, Prince,” said Kitey, “that
was a narrow escape. Were you scared?”</p>

<p>“Scared!” replied the boy; “I’d have given
anything to have been on top of the solid
ground, especially that time we stuck on the
rock, hey, old man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” said the elf emphatically. “But
we’re all right now,” he added, as the sides and
roof of the tunnel suddenly disappeared from
view, “for here we are on the lake, and there is
the light of the Gnomes’ fires in the distance.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking, the table gradually
slackened its pace, and finally came to a standstill
on the calm bosom of the lake.</p>

</div>

<p>“I think we shall have to paddle our own
canoe,” said Harry. “Get on this side with
your board, and I’ll take the other side. It will
be slow work, but we can do no better.”</p>

<p>The plan did not work, however, for Kitey’s
piece of board was too heavy for the little fellow,
so Harry endeavored to paddle the craft
alone; but their progress was so slow and
crooked that they would probably have been
there to this day had they found no other means
of propulsion.</p>

<p>“I think it would go straighter,” Kitey suggested,
“if you should give one stroke at a
time on each side, and make the strokes even.”</p>

<p>To which Harry replied, “I say, old fellow,
if you know so well how to paddle this vessel,
you’d better do it, and I’ll resign. I think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
though, if you ’tend to your own knitting, and
steer a little, it will go easier.”</p>

<p>“Steer!” Kitey said, in an injured tone;
“how can a little fellow like me steer, when you
take one weak stroke on one side, and then two
great, big strokes on the other, and turn the
table half-way around?”</p>

<p>As they were creeping, or rather wobbling,
slowly along, most of the time sidewise like a
crab, all of a sudden they ran into a strong
current of wind, blowing directly towards the
land of the Gnomes.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Kitey. “The wind is
turned on over at our place and will help us
across.”</p>

<p>“It will do more than help,” said Harry.
“I’m going to make it do all the work.”</p>

<p>So saying, he hastily untied the table-cloth
and emptied out the food, and then fastened
the cloth across the two front legs of the table
and made a very fair substitute for a sail.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “we’ll both steer, and perhaps
we can keep the old craft headed straight.”</p>

<p>After that they went along finely, and at a
fair rate of speed, and eventually drew near the
landing-place at Gnome Land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“What plan have you in view, Prince Harry?”
inquired Kitey.</p>

<p>“I have no plan at present,” Harry answered,
much to the elf’s astonishment, for he thought
that Harry had a plan ready for any emergency
which might arise.</p>

<p>“I want to find out how Wamby and the
rest are situated,” explained Harry; “we’ll
consult with him before we settle upon any
definite plan of action.”</p>

<p>Great was the excitement as they sailed up
to the landing-place in their strange boat. In
a second the shore was crowded with Pin Elves,
dancing with glee, gesticulating wildly, and asking
innumerable questions.</p>

<p>“Stand back, and give us room to land!”
said Harry peremptorily. “I can’t answer any
questions now,” he added, for he noticed that
some Gnomes, who were poking the fires near
by, had stopped work and pricked up their ears
to hear what was said. “Tell me where
Wamby is.”</p>

<p>“In the Reception Hall,” shouted an officious
little chap. “I’ll show you the way, master.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Harry, “we’ll find him.
Go ahead, Kitey, and I’ll follow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>The elves fell back and bowed low as Kitey
advanced, but no one ventured to follow him
and Harry.</p>

<p>The two comrades made their way rapidly to
the entrance of the Grand Royal Reception
Hall, and were delighted, on being ushered in,
to see Wamby seated on the throne at the further
end. The little fellow did not wait for
them to reach him, but before they were half-way
down the Hall rushed forward joyfully to
meet them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Prince! master!” he cried, and began
hugging Harry’s feet.</p>

<p>Harry lifted him up in both hands and gave
him a gentle squeeze. “How d’ye do, old
chap!” he exclaimed. “I’m awfully glad to
find you safe!”</p>

<p>“And here’s Kitey, too!” cried Wamby,
embracing his old friend. “Come and sit down
and tell me where you have been, and how you
came here.”</p>

<p>When they had told their story, Wamby discussed
with them their future plans. They
finally decided to gather all of the Pin Elves
together, and attempt to recover their own
dominions from the Gnomes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>While messengers were sent to collect the
elves, the three friends went to the landing-place.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Harry, when they came there,
“the wind is still blowing from the other side.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot about that!” Wamby cried
in dismay. “It has been blowing all the time
we have been here. I think the Gnomes on the
other side keep it turned on, in order to prevent
our sailing across.”</p>

<p>“Well, say,” said Kitey, “it seems to me if
we turn on the wind here, it will be strong
enough to more than counteract the other
wind.”</p>

<p>The suggestion was acted upon, and it was
found that the strong current there entirely
overcame the current blowing towards them.
Therefore they gathered together the whole
fleet of the Gnoman ships, every Pin Elf
scrambled aboard, and they were soon merrily
sailing towards home. The Head Caterer of
the King of the Gnomes and his men were
left behind. As none of the vessels were left,
it was, of course, impossible for them to follow
the Pin Elves.</p>

<p>The fleet made good progress at the start,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
but the speed diminished perceptibly as they
proceeded, and when they were about half-way
across, every ship came to a dead standstill.</p>

<p>“The Caterer must have turned off the
wind!” exclaimed Wamby.</p>

<p>“No, Your Majesty,” said Kitey, “for I can
feel it blowing yet. Why, that’s funny! It
seems to blow from both sides!”</p>

<p>“I know what’s the matter,” cried Harry.
“The wind is turned on at both sides at once,
and we are just in the middle, where the two
opposing currents are equal; consequently, we
can’t go forward or back. We are stuck here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand how it is, Prince,” said
Kitey.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s plain enough,” returned Harry.
“Suppose you and Wamby were pushing against
each other with equal force, what would happen?”</p>

<p>“We’d both stand still,” answered Kitey.</p>

<p>“Exactly!” said Harry; “and that is just
our case. The wind is pushing us before and
behind, and we are standing still. Now, if we
could only paddle one of these boats across, we
could turn off the wind, and then the rest of
the fleet could sail over. There are no oars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
but these thwarts are light enough. Get two
dozen of the strongest elves in here with me,
and we’ll soon accomplish it.”</p>

<p>The sails being taken down, the boat under
Harry’s charge was paddled over. The wind
was then turned off, the other vessels sailed
across, and the elves disembarked.</p>

<p>“Now, Wamby,” asked Harry, “how many
weapons have you?”</p>

<p>“A thousand spears,” replied Wamby.</p>

<p>It seems that the Pin Elves had all been disarmed
when banished, but Wamby had at once
set a number of them at work manufacturing
new spears, and they had completed about a
thousand when Harry arrived. With these
Harry armed a thousand of the elves.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he to Wamby, “you take the
rest of the men around to the armory and procure
arms for them, and then bring them to
the room adjoining the Grand Reception Hall,
where Kitey and I will be waiting with our
force.”</p>

<p>So saying, he and Kitey led the thousand
armed elves to the place of rendezvous. When
they had quietly entered the room, Harry tiptoed
to the passage leading to the Reception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
Hall, and suddenly rushing in, grasped by the
neck the two Gnomes guarding the door there,
and carried them back to the room, where they
were gagged and bound. Then, leaving orders
for his men to follow at a given signal, he and
Kitey entered the passage, with the intention of
looking into the Reception Hall.</p>

<p>They had gotten within about eight feet of
the door, when suddenly, without any warning,
the door flew open and a large body of the
Gnomes rushed upon them. Poor little Kitey
was seized by a dozen at once, and hustled
into the Reception Hall before he had a chance
to strike a blow. At the same time, a hundred
Gnomes tripped up Harry with strong ropes,
and despite his kicks and struggles he, too, was
dragged into the Reception Hall, and was in a
trice securely bound hand and foot.</p>

<p>Then the door was shut and bolted, although
the bolting was unnecessary, for the Pin Elves
had been deprived of their door-pins when they
had been banished. Harry still retained his pin
concealed under the lapel of his coat, but Kitey
had loaned his to Wamby.</p>

<p>The two prisoners were carried before the
King and laid upon the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed the King, in a snarling
tone. “We Gnomes are not quite so stupid as
you imagined. My spies have been watching
your movements ever since you landed. The
thousand elves that came with you are safe
where they are; they have no door-pin, and I
shall just leave them alone there, and let them
starve.</p>

<p>“As for Wamby and his crowd—ah, here
is a messenger now that will tell us about them!
Make your report,” he said to Smithkin, who
had just entered the hall.</p>

<p>With an obsequious bow, Smithkin began:
“If it please Your Royal Majesty, we were waiting
outside the chamber with the great trap-door
in the floor. Wamby and his followers
presently appeared and entered the chamber
without discovering our ambush. I cautiously
crept forward and inserted my door-pin in
the hole controlling the trap-door, and just as
Wamby inserted his pin in the door leading out
of the chamber, I pressed upon my pin and
dumped them all into the dungeon below. As
soon as the floor swung back into place, I ran
forward and secured Wamby’s door-pin, which
had remained sticking in the hole, and I now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
have the honor of presenting it to Your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the King, with a malicious
chuckle. “So they’re safe too. Ha, ha! I’ll
just let them starve with the others. Eh,
Prince?” he went on, with a taunting look
at Harry; “a fine Prince you are, to get your
followers into such a scrape! Oh, I’ve a
notion to kill you both at once!” he growled
savagely, and shook his pickax menacingly at
them. “But we’ll wait till after dinner, and
then my royal colleague, Cattisack, and my
Lord of the Safety-Pin can have the pleasure
of torturing you a little. Take the prisoners
over yonder, and you, Smithkin, guard them
while we eat!”</p>

<p>The King arose, and with two attendant
Gnomes reverently bearing his great, gray
beard, he walked to the table and seated
himself. The whole company followed his
example, and soon they were all busily eating
and talking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the two prisoners had been
dragged to one side of the Hall and left
there, with no one but Smithkin near them.</p>

<p>Smithkin looked glum, and no wonder; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
after the work he had done, it was very hard to
be obliged to perform guard duty and to have
nothing to eat. Harry guessed his thoughts,
and made up his mind to profit by his discontent.</p>

<p>“Smithkin,” he whispered, “it’s rather mean
not to give you anything to eat. I would treat
you better than that if you were working for
me.”</p>

<p>Smithkin scowled, and said nothing.</p>

<p>“Is any one in the room looking this way?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p>The soldier glanced over the Hall, and shook
his head slowly.</p>

<p>“Then,” continued Harry, “slip your hand
in my left coat-pocket, and take what you find
there.”</p>

<p>With a quick movement Smithkin did so,
and drew forth the three jewels. He gave
one glance at them, and then thrust them into
the bosom of his jacket, and standing erect
again, whispered, “What do you want me
to do?”</p>

<p>“Simply keep your eye turned away from me
for a minute,” said Harry; “and don’t listen
very hard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>With some little effort the boy managed to
get his right hand loose enough to slip it into
his coat-pocket, where he had placed the paper-cutter.
Drawing it out, he inserted its point
under the cords that bound his hands, and after
a deal of sawing was able to cut one or two of
the bonds, and free his hands. It was then an
easy matter to get out his penknife, cut the
bonds of Kitey, who was lying close beside him,
and quietly reach down and sever the cords
about his own ankles.</p>

<p>All this while, Smithkin was staring stolidly
at the opposite side of the Hall, with his back
turned to the two prisoners.</p>

<p>“Lie perfectly still, Kitey,” whispered Harry.</p>

<p>Then making sure that his limbs were free,
he sprang to his feet, gave Smithkin a vigorous
kick that sent him sprawling on his face, took
Kitey in his arms, and dashing down the Hall,
threw the little fellow on top of a piece of furniture
like a wardrobe, standing against the wall,
and vaulted up beside him.</p>

<p>In an instant all was hubbub and excitement.
Smithkin, with a shriek, grabbed his spear and
rushed after Harry. The table where Grumpy
and his adherents were eating was overturned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
and my Lord of the Safety-Pin was pinned
to the floor under it, yelling and howling like
mad. The Gnoman soldiers started for their
spears. The King of the Gnomes tried unaided
to push his chair back, and in some way his feet
got tangled up in his beard, his chair upset, and
he lay sprawling upon his back, with his great
beard flopping in the gravy and other victuals
on the table.</p>

<p>In the midst of the rumpus some one called,
“Smithkin is a traitor! He set them free!”</p>

<p>Instantly there was a hoarse cry from all
over the Hall: “Catch Smithkin! Punish the
traitor!”</p>

<p>“Save me, Prince!” cried the terrified soldier.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Harry, “reach me your
hand.” And grasping the outstretched hand,
he swung Smithkin up beside him, on top of
the wardrobe.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SECRET DOOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Smithkin escaped not a moment too soon,
for as he dropped in a heap beside Harry, a
hundred angry Gnomes were brandishing their
spears beneath. Smithkin was no coward
when he had half a chance to fight and defend
himself, and he brandished his own spear
in return, and yelled defiance at the constantly
increasing crowd.</p>

<p>The piece of furniture on which the besieged
ones were standing, looked like a long
wardrobe, and for convenience sake we shall
call it a wardrobe, although really it had
been used by the Pin Elves as a place for
keeping their spears when they were not in
use. It seemed low to Harry, but it was too
high for even the tallest of the Gnomes to
reach the top with his spear; so, for the present,
the boy and his two companions were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
secure from attack. Fortunately, the Pin Elves
and Gnomes are unable to hurl their spears
at an enemy. They can fight at close quarters
only, by thrusting with the weapon.</p>

<p>Kitey, being unarmed, was directed by Harry
to stand back against the wall and keep a
sharp lookout over the Hall, in order to prevent
any sudden surprises.</p>

<p>The King of the Gnomes by this time was
seated upon the throne, and on each side of
him sat Cattisack and Grumpy. The three
were earnestly talking together.</p>

<p>“Prince,” Kitey said in a low voice, so as
not to be heard by the Gnomes below, “the
King of the Gnomes seems to be consulting
with our former King and the Lord of the
Safety-Pin. Now he is giving orders to his
attendants, and they are running down the
Hall. Look, Prince! they are bringing a table
and chairs, and are going to climb up here!”</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited, old man,” said Harry.
“I’ve been waiting for them to do something
of the kind.”</p>

<p>The boy stood calmly with his right hand
in his coat-pocket while the Gnomes dragged a
table up to the wardrobe and clambered upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“Now, Smithkin!” he cried, “poke them
with the butt end of your spear!” And at the
same time he drew forth his little pop-gun and
fired pointblank at the foremost Gnome. The
cork struck the fellow between the eyes, and
over he went backwards, knocking half a dozen
of the other Gnomes off the table as he fell.
The unexpected report of the pistol, and the
disastrous result of the shot, threw the Gnomes
on Smithkin’s side off their guard, and with a
quick, vigorous thrust of his long spear-handle,
the soldier knocked four more from the table.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Harry recovered the cork,
which was attached to the pistol by a cord,
and setting the spring, he pushed the cork in
as tight as he could, and fired again. The
report was so loud that the few Gnomes still
upon the table tumbled off from sheer fright.</p>

<p>The King of the Gnomes, seeing that this
attempt had failed, gave orders to try another
plan for dislodging Harry and his companions.
Soon a number of Gnomes began bringing in
armfuls of wood, which they piled near the
wardrobe.</p>

<p>“They are going to burn us out!” cried
Kitey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image111" style="max-width: 36.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image111.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">ON THE WARDROBE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t worry!” said Harry. “They can’t
do it.”</p>

<p>And so it turned out, for whenever a Gnome
ventured near and endeavored to place some
wood against the foot of the wardrobe, Harry
would lean over and extend his right hand,
“pop!” would go the pistol, and over the
Gnome would tumble.</p>

<p>Perhaps if a large number of them had
rushed forward simultaneously, they might have
accomplished their purpose; but they were
afraid of the mysterious little weapon, that
made such a terrible noise and knocked them
senseless at a distance of several feet, and only
a bold fellow now and then dared venture
within range.</p>

<p>Finally, a messenger came with new orders
from the King, and the Gnomes began laying
the wood in a semicircle about eight feet from
the wardrobe and extending from the wall on
one side around to the wall on the other side.</p>

<p>“They’re going to smoke us out!” exclaimed
Smithkin. “Hit them with your magic weapon,
Prince!”</p>

<p>Harry tried to do so, but the string was too
short to allow the cork to reach any of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind,” said he; “that little pile
of wood is too far away to hurt us. There
won’t be smoke enough from it.”</p>

<p>Smithkin shook his head dolefully. “Don’t
laugh until they are done!” he said.</p>

<p>Harry did laugh contemptuously, however,
while the Gnomes set fire to the wood; but
his laugh soon faded away as some of the
Gnomes sprinkled a powder on the flames, and
immediately a dense, black, stifling smoke slowly
arose and curled towards them from all sides.</p>

<p>“I say, boys, they have us this time!” he
cried in dismay. “We can’t stand this; we’ll
have to jump down and fight in about half a
minute.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Prince Harry,” said Smithkin,
beckoning and pointing down; “here is a door
in the wall close to my end of the wardrobe;
perhaps we can slip through it and escape.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any door,” said Harry, stooping
down, and looking at the place indicated.</p>

<p>“You can’t see it,” replied the soldier, “but
it’s there, and if you will quietly lift me down
and give me your door-pin, I will open it.”</p>

<p>Just then a thick cloud of smoke enveloped
them, and set them coughing and choking, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Harry hastily lowered himself to the floor and
lifted his two companions down. The curtain
of smoke completely screened them from the
Gnomes on the other side of the fire.</p>

<p>Smithkin knew the exact spot in which to insert
the door-pin,—for when he was commander
of the King’s body-guard, it was often his duty
to use the various secret doors and passages of
which the common Pin Elves were ignorant,—and
the three comrades quietly passed into
an outer passage and closed the door behind
them, without any one in the Hall knowing of
their escape.</p>

<p>In perfect silence the soldier led them onward,
until they found themselves in the chamber
under the rock in Central Park.</p>

<p>“Now, Prince,” said Smithkin, “you know
where we are. What are your orders?”</p>

<p>“You and Kitey wait here a moment,” replied
Harry, “and I will go around through the
Passage of the Toad and see what the Gnomes
are doing.”</p>

<p>The boy hurried away and soon came to
the spot in the main passage where the toad
was tied up.</p>

<p>“Poor little hoppy!” he cried, “you’re having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
a hard time of it. I’ll set you free from that
old rag, at any rate.”</p>

<p>Having untied the cloth in which the toad
was imprisoned, he ran on to the end of the
passage, mounted the steps, and gently opened
the trap-door on a crack. Just as he did so, he
heard the King of the Gnomes say, “Extinguish
the fire! The knaves must be suffocated by
this time.”</p>

<p>Harry peeped through, and saw the Gnomes
putting out the semicircle of flame. Gradually
the black smoke cleared away, and the Gnomes
discovered to their amazement that the top of
the wardrobe was empty.</p>

<p>“Glumdozo!” roared the King, “the varlets
have escaped!”</p>

<p>Search was made inside of the wardrobe and
all around it, but of course it was in vain.</p>

<p>At this point Cattisack, the former King of
the Pin Elves, leaned over and whispered to the
King of the Gnomes, “Your Majesty, I think
they must have escaped through a secret door
near where they were.”</p>

<p>Harry heard the whisper, for he could almost
touch the two Kings from his place of concealment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>The King of the Gnomes forthwith commanded
his soldiers to institute a strict search
for the fugitives, but before the searchers left
the Hall, the boy had softly closed the trap-door,
and was on his way back to Smithkin and
Kitey.</p>

<p>“Quick!” said he to the soldier, as he ran
up to them, “lead the way at once to the
prison.”</p>

<p>Smithkin did so, and they reached the room
before any of the Gnomes appeared.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Harry, taking from his pocket
the lantern-box which Kitey had loaned him,
“open the trap-door, and we’ll go down and
rescue Wamby and the men with him.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” exclaimed Smithkin, “so that is
your plan.”</p>

<p>They quickly made their way over the course
Harry and Wamby had travelled during the
boy’s former visit, and when they came to the
edge of the lake they turned off and proceeded
to the chamber with the great trap-door. Opening
the door that led to the stairs under the
incline, they ran down the long flight of stairs
and emerged in the dungeon where Wamby and
the rest were confined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>A joyous shout greeted them: “Hurrah!
here’s the Prince! Here’s little Kitey! Here’s
old Smithkin!”</p>

<p>Harry glanced around, and a disappointed
look came into his face. “You are not
armed!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No,” Wamby made reply, “we found the
armory without any trouble, but it was empty;
the Gnomes had removed all of the weapons, so
we were unable to arm ourselves. Then, as we
were on our way to join you and your men, the
rascally Gnomes dumped us down here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harry, “I know about that. I
am sorry, though, that you are unarmed, for
that leaves us with only a thousand men ready
to fight, and we cannot conquer the Gnomes
with that number. However, let us get out of
this hole, and join the thousand men in the
antechamber above. Come quietly; there may
be Gnoman spies about.”</p>

<p>The poor fellows were glad enough to be
released from their prison, and when they
reached the antechamber adjoining the Grand
Reception Hall they were warmly welcomed
by their thousand comrades.</p>

<p>Leaving Kitey to tell the elves all that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
thus far happened, Harry drew Wamby and
Smithkin aside for consultation.</p>

<p>“What is there to be done now?” he asked,
after he had given Wamby a brief history of
what had befallen them. “We have but a
thousand men that are armed, and even they
are practically useless, for the door into the
Hall is bolted on the inside.”</p>

<p>“You might go around through the Passage
of the Toad,” said Wamby, “and see what is
taking place in the Hall.”</p>

<p>“How can I get there?” Harry inquired.</p>

<p>“Why,” replied Wamby, “one of the small,
branching passages runs from this antechamber.
The door is over in that corner. When
the passage was built, the intention was to
afford means of escape in various directions,
so the small passages branch out on all sides.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go down at once,” said Harry.
“You quietly tell your men to be prepared
for anything that may happen, and to be ready to
obey without questioning any orders I may give.”</p>

<p>When the boy reached the trap-door behind
the throne, the King of the Gnomes was on the
point of receiving a report from his men, who
had been searching for the three fugitives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>Harry silently chuckled as he heard the King
demand, “Have you found the fugitives?”</p>

<p>“If it please Your Majesty,” was the answer,
“we have looked everywhere and can discover
no traces of them whatever.”</p>

<p>“Hum! hah!” growled the King.</p>

<p>He stroked his beard for several minutes,
and then arose, saying, “Prepare the tables
for a banquet on our return in half an
hour.”</p>

<p>Having given this command, he left the Hall
with his attendants, and his example was shortly
followed by all of the Gnomes except the servants
who were to prepare the banquet. These
began to put the tables in order, and then presently
brought in dishes of all kinds of tempting
food.</p>

<p>The sight made Harry’s mouth water, for he
had had nothing to eat for a long time and was
ravenously hungry.</p>

<p>“I’ll run out and capture some victuals again
when the Hall is empty,” he said to himself,
smacking his lips in anticipation. But as he
waited, a picture of Wamby and the other Pin
Elves in the antechamber rose before him.
“Poor little beggars!” he thought. “They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
are more hungry than I, and I’m going to give
them a share of the food, even if I get caught
by the Gnomes.”</p>

<p>When all had been prepared, the servants
withdrew as before, and left the Hall empty.
This was the opportunity for which Harry was
looking. He darted forth from his hiding-place
to the door of the antechamber, drew back the
bolts, and called to the Pin Elves, “A hundred
of you that are unarmed, come quickly!”</p>

<p>Leading them to the tables, the boy said,
“Each one of you take a dish of food and run
back with it.”</p>

<p>They did so right willingly, and in a trice
the tables were entirely cleared of provisions.
Harry secured a dish of food for himself, and
having bolted the door again behind the Pin
Elves, in order to throw the Gnomes off the
scent, he ran back to his own place of concealment
beneath the trap-door in the Passage
of the Toad.</p>

<p>The King of the Gnomes was in a towering
passion when he came in and found that his
dinner had again mysteriously disappeared. He
banished all of the servants to the mines,
greatly to Harry’s delight, for every Gnome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
thus banished weakened the power of the
Gnomes and added to the strength of the
Pin Elves. Then the King ordered other servants
to prepare a fresh meal, and he and his
attendants left the Hall once more.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho! old fellow!” cried Harry to himself,
shaking his fist at the King as he passed
out; “I have a scheme this time that will upset
your plans entirely, and will probably send
you below, where you belong. Just you wait
awhile, and I’ll furnish sauce, and perhaps
guests also, for your dinner!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br>
<span class="fs80">A MIGHTY BATTLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When the King of the Gnomes had gone,
the new servants hurried away to the kitchen
to help the cooks in the preparation of a second
meal. As soon as the door closed behind them,
Harry sprang into the room, shut the trap-door,
and stealthily made his way to the door of the
antechamber. Quietly slipping back the bolts,
he opened it and beckoned the Pin Elves to
enter the Hall.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a noise!” he cautioned, as
they swarmed in. “Those of you armed with
spears take your station on each side of the
main door opposite. Smithkin, you take command
of them. A couple of you others run
to the door leading to the kitchen, and bolt it
so that the servants cannot return. And you,
Kitey, see if there are any weapons in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
wardrobe, and if you find any, distribute them
as far as they will go.”</p>

<p>There were only about a hundred spears in
the wardrobe, and Kitey distributed them among
a hundred picked elves. These Harry placed
in a line at the foot of the steps leading up to
the dais. Then he seated Wamby on the throne,
and directed the great body of unarmed elves
to stand upon the raised dais on each side of
and behind the throne.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed his forces, Harry said:
“You hundred men are King Wamby’s body-guard.
Under no consideration are you to
leave him. You must protect his person, and
also do what you can to protect your unarmed
comrades on the dais. Now, Kitey, you and I
will go to help Smithkin.”</p>

<p>Brave little Kitey had selected a terrible-looking
spear about twice as long as himself,
and with this resting upon his shoulder he trotted
gleefully beside Harry down the long Hall.</p>

<p>The boy took his stand by the side of the
door where the hinges were, so that he would
be behind the door when it opened, and having
placed Smithkin upon the other side, and directed
the elves to keep close to the wall and to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
nothing till he gave the word, he awaited the
coming of the Gnomes.</p>

<p>Thus there were ranged close to the wall on
one side of the doorway, Smithkin and five hundred
elves; and on the other side, Harry and
Kitey with five hundred elves.</p>

<p>Presently the door swung open, and the advance
body-guard of the King of the Gnomes
marched into the Hall without looking to the
right or left. The elfin soldiers remained like
statues; no one moved a muscle. Harry waited,
every nerve in his body quivering with suppressed
excitement, until the advance-guard had
passed and the King of the Gnomes himself
stepped into the Hall. Then he slammed to
the door, slipped the bolts into place, and
shouted to the elves, “Now, capture them!”</p>

<p>Harry’s plan had been to admit the King of
the Gnomes and take him prisoner, and shut
out the main body of the Gnomes themselves.
Then, with the King in his power, he could
bring them speedily to terms. But his plan
only partly succeeded.</p>

<p>The Gnoman soldiers marched as soldiers
should, with “eyes front,” and failed to see
the ambuscade laid for them. But the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
little attendants, who were bearing the King
of the Gnomes’ beard, were darting their sharp,
black eyes in all directions, and the moment
they stepped into the Hall they espied Smithkin
and his men. Instantly they dropped the King’s
beard and rushed back into the passageway.
That warned the King that something was
wrong, and he hastily stepped back into the
passage, just as Harry slammed the door shut.
But, though the King had escaped being taken
prisoner in the Hall, he was captured in another
way; for the door shut upon his long, gray
beard, and thus he was securely held fast.</p>

<p>Harry, however, did not know about that,
but supposed the King had escaped entirely.
The boy, therefore, turned his attention to the
Gnoman soldiers in the Hall.</p>

<p>There were some two hundred of them, the
flower of the Gnoman army, but of course they
stood no chance against a thousand spry Pin
Elves. Before they had time to recover from
their surprise at discovering the trap they had
walked into, they were surrounded by the elves,
who, disdaining to use their spear-points, laid
about them with the shafts of their weapons,
and knocked them right and left without mercy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and in short order had them overcome and
disarmed.</p>

<p>“Bind them,” commanded Harry, “and carry
them over to yonder corner.”</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged, a terrible
shout arose from the elves upon the dais.
Harry turned about and beheld Cattisack and
Grumpy leading the main body of the Gnomes
into the Hall, through the secret door by the
wardrobe.</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” cried the boy. “I forgot all
about that door! Quick, Smithkin, get your
men in order!”</p>

<p>That was easier said than done, for the elves
had dropped their spears while binding the
Gnoman body-guards, and before they had all
recovered their weapons, the foremost of the
enemy was upon them.</p>

<p>Harry in his excitement felt in the wrong
pocket for his pop-pistol, and not finding that
useful weapon, grabbed up a small table standing
near, and tilting it up on edge with the top
in front of him, he ran forward, pushing it along
the floor, and mowed down a wide swath through
the ranks of the advancing Gnomes. Again he
turned, and levelled another row of them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
yet again, sweeping another hundred of them
down.</p>

<p>But now they began scattering over the Hall,
and adroitly dodging to the right and left as he
charged impetuously back and forth, and his
breath also began giving out, and he found himself
obliged to rest a moment.</p>

<p>The instant he paused, a vast swarm of the
Gnomes was about him, pricking his legs with
their sharp spears, clinging by scores to his feet
and ankles, and some of the bolder ones even
starting to climb up his legs. Two or three
times the boy shook them off, and by vigorous
kicking managed to clear a little space about
him. But finally he could endure the torment
no longer, and with a whoop and yell he dashed
through the dense mass and ran madly up the Hall.</p>

<p>Right in his path stood Cattisack and Grumpy,
grinning maliciously at his discomfiture and defeat.
That was more than any boy could stand.
He made straight for them, and with a tremendous
kick sent them flying through the air. Then
he turned aside and vaulted upon the top of the
wardrobe and sat down, out of breath, his legs
smarting from a hundred spear-pricks.</p>

<p>It gave him no little satisfaction, however, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
he looked around, to observe that Cattisack and
Grumpy were lying motionless where he had
kicked them. They were not killed, however,
but only disabled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Smithkin and Kitey, with their
companions, had been having their hands full.
Two or three of them had failed to find their
weapons, and had been immediately captured by
the enemy; the remainder formed themselves
in a circle, and for a while bravely repelled the
charges of the Gnomes; but one after another
went down before the repeated assaults, and at
length the Gnomes broke the circle and caused
a large number to seek safety in flight.</p>

<p>This disheartened the remainder, and they,
too, were on the point of fleeing, when Smithkin
thought of the two hundred and fifty Pin
Elves of the old King’s body-guard, who had
gone over to the Gnomes with him in the last
battle. They were standing together in a body
not far off, taking no part in the struggle.
Smithkin knew they had turned traitors chiefly
because of their personal attachment to himself,
and thinking he might win them back
again, he waved his spear at them and gave the
old battle-cry of the body-guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>The fellows were really longing to help their
old commander, and upon hearing his familiar
war-cry they charged the Gnomes madly and
were soon beside Smithkin, fighting like tigers.</p>

<p>Thus far the battle had been confined to the
lower part of the Hall. But when the Gnomes
found they made little impression upon Smithkin’s
band, a large body of them quietly withdrew,
marched to the upper end of the Hall, and
charged the line of men at the foot of the dais.
These were, as I have said, picked elves, and
being perfectly fresh, they repelled each charge
without losing a man or giving way an inch.</p>

<p>The Gnomes then tried a new mode of attack.
They retreated a little distance, and forming
themselves into a wedge-shaped mass, charged
straight for the throne.</p>

<p>Harry saw in a moment what they were
about to do, and roared at the top of his voice,
“Smithkin! run to help Wamby! he’s in
danger!”</p>

<p>With a yell to his men to follow, the brave
commander broke through the line of Gnomes
in front of him, dashed up the Hall, and reached
the attacking party just as they were forcing
their way up the steps of the throne. Hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
his terrible battle-cry behind them, the Gnomes
turned about and paused an instant. That
brief pause saved Wamby from capture, for ere
the Gnomes could turn again, Smithkin’s men
in two bodies were attacking them on each
flank.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image131" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image131.jpg" alt="Boy with hand out">
</figure>

<p>Smithkin himself forced his way to the commander
of the Gnomes, who was standing on
the lower step of the dais, directly in front of
the throne. The Pin Elf commander, grasping
his stout spear by the shaft, used it as a club
or battle-ax, and every time he swung it back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
and forth a number of Gnomes dropped senseless
to the floor. Quickly he hewed a path
before him, until he was face to face with the
Gnoman commander. Then with a triumphant
cry he raised the spear aloft and aimed a mighty
blow at the fellow’s head. But the commander
of the Gnomes at the same time raised his own
spear in both hands horizontally above his head
and caught the blow upon it, and Smithkin’s
weapon was broken in twain.</p>

<p>Harry groaned aloud as he saw the defenceless
plight of the Pin Elf champion.</p>

<p>King Wamby had been sitting on the edge of
the throne, watching the conflict with breathless
interest. In his hand he held the sceptre, or
golden pickax, which the King of the Gnomes
had left by the throne. As soon as the accident
happened to Smithkin’s spear, he cried
out, “Here, Smithkin, take this!” and tossed
the golden pickax to him.</p>

<p>Smithkin deftly caught the implement by the
handle, leaped upon the lower step of the dais,
and smote the commander of the Gnomes such
a terrible blow that he dropped senseless upon
the floor.</p>

<p>At the sight Harry was beside himself with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
joy, and impetuously catching the elfin hat from
his head, he threw it high in the air with a loud
hurrah. Instantly he realized what he had
done, for as soon as the hat was off, Pin Elves
and Gnomes disappeared from view.</p>

<span class="fs80">IN THE DARK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Harry’s hat fell in the midst of a group of
Gnomes, and was taken possession of by one
of them. Although the boy could see nothing,
he could still hear what was going on in the
Hall, and his heart sank within him at the
hoarse shout of triumph that went up from
the Gnomes as they captured the precious
trophy.</p>

<p>Wamby’s voice now came to his ears: “A
golden hat-pin and the richest jewel in my
treasures to any elf who will regain my hat!”</p>

<p>For the hat really belonged to Wamby, and
of course it was of vital importance for him to
get it back.</p>

<p>Presently Harry heard shrill voices crying,
“Smithkin to the rescue! Well done! Bravely
done! Hurrah! Smithkin has the hat!”</p>

<p>Then, after a moment of comparative quiet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the Gnomes began to yell hoarsely, “Here
comes our King! We’ll conquer them now!
Put the King on the throne! Down with the
elves! Down with Wamby!”</p>

<p>At once a confused uproar sounded throughout
the Hall, hoarse cries and shrill shrieks, the
clashing of weapons, and the patter of many
feet running to and fro. Above all could be
heard ever and anon the fierce, defiant battle-cry
of Smithkin, and wherever that cry came
from, there was always the loudest din of battle.</p>

<p>Then above the racket rose poor little
Kitey’s shrill, piercing voice, “Smithkin has
lost his weapon! Smithkin is down! Oh,
Prince Harry, Wamby is captured! We are
lost—lost!”</p>

<p>Then followed a prolonged, hoarse shout from
the triumphant Gnomes.</p>

<p>Harry groaned once more, and shook his
fist in impotent rage at the invisible enemy,
whereat some of the Gnomes standing near
laughed derisively.</p>

<p>Presently he heard the King of the Gnomes’
gruff voice demand, “Have Cattisack and
Grumpy been revived? Then bring them
here, and seat them beside me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>All was still again for a few minutes, and
then Kitey’s shrill voice piped forth, “Look
out, Prince, they’re trying to put a rope around
your feet!”</p>

<p>Harry reached down and felt cords about his
ankles, and immediately began to kick about vigorously
and to flourish his arms in the air. But
he forgot how small the top of the wardrobe
was, and stepping over the edge, he fell heavily
to the stone floor and became unconscious.</p>

<p>When he came to himself, his hands and feet
were bound, and he was lying upon the floor in
front of the throne. Though he saw no one,
he could hear the King of the Gnomes talking
in a low tone with ex-King Cattisack. Finally
the King of the Gnomes said in a louder tone,
“Gather all of the Pin Elves together, and take
them down to the mines.”</p>

<p>The confused sounds which ensued, and the
loud patter of many feet on the stone floor, indicated
that the order was being carried out.</p>

<p>When quiet was restored, the King of the
Gnomes growled forth, “And now what shall
be done with that knave?”</p>

<p>Though Harry could not see, he felt that
the big right eye was upon himself. Cattisack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
seemed to make some suggestion, but he spoke
too low for Harry to distinguish what he said.</p>

<p>“Just the thing!” exclaimed the King of the
Gnomes. “Open this trap-door behind me, and
dump the fellow into the Passage of the Toad.”</p>

<p>Forthwith the boy was unceremoniously
dragged on his back up the steps of the dais
and dumped feet foremost down the steps of
the Passage of the Toad. Then the door was
closed, and he was left in utter darkness.</p>

<p>He lay quietly at the bottom of the stairway
for a few minutes, trying to study out why he
had been put in that place. Finally he laughed
softly.</p>

<p>“Either they think I am afraid of the toad,”
he said to himself, “or else they believe I am
bound too securely to get free myself, and that
the Pin Elves will not dare to rescue me from
this terrible passage.”</p>

<p>After a hard struggle he succeeded in freeing
himself from his bonds. Then he searched
carefully in all of his pockets and found three
matches. One of these he lighted, and made
his way along the passage until he reached the
spot where the smaller passages branched off,
when his match went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll save the other matches to find the pin-hole
in the door,” said he.</p>

<p>His object was to get out through the trap-door
where he had first come down when he
found Kitey. He believed that it would be easy
to find the prison, and from there go down to
the mines, where he could cheer up Wamby and
the others and perhaps rescue them once more.</p>

<p>“Now, which of these passages is the right
one?” he thought to himself. “Let me see.
It was the third,—no, it was the second from
this end; yes, I’m sure that is the one.”</p>

<p>He felt his way along the wall, entered the
second opening, and slowly went along the
passage in the dark until he came to the end.
There he found the stairs, but instead of going
up as he expected, they went down; consequently
he missed his footing and also went
down,—on his back,—for some little distance.</p>

<p>“I took the wrong passage after all,” he
muttered, as he recovered his footing. “This
is the one that leads to the river. I may as
well go on to the end of it and take a look.”</p>

<p>Cautiously he felt his way down the remainder
of the steps and along the passage to
the door at the end. There he lighted one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
of the remaining matches, found the pin-hole,
and opened the door. Holding the lighted
match above his head, he stepped out upon
the little stone platform or landing-place, and
carefully examined the wall of the tunnel.
“Even if I could find a boat,” he said, half
aloud, “I don’t believe I’d risk going down
the rapids in the dark.” Consequently he decided
to make the rest of the journey to the
lake on foot. On the other side of the lake
was the kingdom of the Gnomes. The journey
in the dark was a long and severe one,
but after several hours he arrived footsore
and weary at the lake, and found the boat in
which he and Wamby had before sailed across
moored among a large fleet on the shore. To
his surprise he discovered also that the wind was
already turned on, but jumping on board the
boat, he arrived safely on the Gnoman shore.</p>

<span class="fs80">SURPRISED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Harry could see no one, of course, as he
walked towards the glowing furnaces, for he
had no elfin hat upon his head. But the elves
soon caught sight of him, and immediately began
dancing about in delight, shouting, “Hurrah!
hurrah! Here is Prince Harry!”</p>

<p>“Somebody bring me a hat,” said Harry.
“I can’t see a single one of you.”</p>

<p>At once a dozen of them ran forward and
cried, “Here, Prince, take mine!” But before
he had a chance to get hold of one of
them, he heard Kitey’s shrill little voice ordering
the others to stand aside.</p>

<p>“Here is Wamby’s hat, dear Prince,” cried
Kitey. “He left it in my care, for he knew
you would come down some time.”</p>

<p>“There, that is better,” said Harry, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
put the hat on his head. “Now, little chap,
let us hurry away to see Wamby.”</p>

<p>They found His Majesty in the Grand Reception
Hall, and Harry told him everything that
had befallen him since they were separated.</p>

<p>“I was sure you would come down soon,”
said Wamby, “and have had all my workmen
making spears. We have enough now to arm
all of the elves; but how can we get across
the lake? The Gnomes not only keep the
wind turned on over there, but also took away
every vessel from this side.”</p>

<p>“I think we can remedy that,” replied Harry.
“Can we not cross the lake on rafts or some
vessels of our own construction? Or better
still, I will cross alone, for I shall only require
one boat; then, once on the other side, I can
bring over the boats for all the rest of
you.”</p>

<p>So the elves, with Harry’s help, constructed,
in less than an hour’s time, a temporary boat,
much like a raft, made of boards nailed together,
and just large enough for Harry to
stand on. They also made a paddle, of a narrow
board with larger ends.</p>

<p>The elves watched breathlessly as he with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
difficulty propelled himself along, the wind
against him, retarding his progress by many
minutes. Undaunted and untiring in his efforts,
he at last made his way to the other
side of the lake, where his first act was to
gather the boats together (for the Gnomes had
left them unguarded, never supposing Harry
could so boldly capture them), then to turn off
the wind entirely, so that it should blow in
neither direction. In safety he once more
went back to his friends, and they all lost no
time, except in grateful thanks to their Prince,
in recrossing the lake to their destination.</p>

<p>They made their way quickly to the antechamber,
but were surprised to find no guards
anywhere on their way. When they reached
that place, and still found no sign of a guard,
and discovered, furthermore, that the door of
the Reception Hall was bolted, Wamby exclaimed,
“Some of the Gnomes must have seen
us and carried word to the King!”</p>

<p>Harry considered a moment, then ordered
Wamby to count the elves, to see if perchance
there was a deserter in the camp. Sure enough,
it was discovered that one of them was missing,
and to their horror and dismay, they knew he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
must have escaped, without their notice, to warn
the Gnomes.</p>

<p>“The traitor!” exclaimed Harry; “but there
is no time to cry over spilled milk. What can
we do now?” After a moment’s consideration
he said, “I have a plan. We can all go through
the Passage of the Toad to the other side of
the Reception Hall and enter the Hall by the
secret door near the wardrobe.”</p>

<p>“But the toad!” said Wamby, in a trembling
voice.</p>

<p>“You won’t have to go near him,” said
Harry. “He is, or was when I saw him last,
at the foot of the steps leading to the trap-door
under the Hall, and you needn’t go to that end
of the main passage at all. We’ll simply go
through the passage that runs from this antechamber,
and that will take us within a step of
the passage that runs up near the chamber
under the rock in the park. Besides, I’ll go
ahead and give warning if the toad is in the
way.”</p>

<p>It was finally agreed to try the plan, and
they all made their way through safely, without
a glimpse of the toad, and reached the secret
door. But that also was bolted on the inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“They have been warned of our coming, as
you feared,” said Wamby.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, so,” replied Harry. “Well,
suppose you and the others remain here while
I reconnoitre. Be ready to rush in if I open
the door.”</p>

<p>Borrowing Wamby’s lantern-box, the boy
went back to the Passage of the Toad, and
mounted the steps leading to the trap-door
under the dais. Part way up the steps, he
found the toad. The steps were very low,
being built for little Pin Elves, so it was easy
enough for a slender toad to hop from one to
another.</p>

<p>“Halloa, little hoppy!” said Harry; “you’re
getting spry, aren’t you? Just keep up courage
a little longer, old fellow, and you’ll be released
from your prison.”</p>

<p>Ascending to the top of the steps, the boy
opened the door slightly, and peered forth.</p>

<p>The Hall was full of Gnomes, most of them
being armed. A large guard was stationed at
each door, but the main body of soldiers was in
the centre of the Hall. The King was upon the
throne, while a few members of his body-guard
were below on the floor a little to his left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Harry studied the situation for a minute, and
then he opened the trap-door, leaped clear over
the throne, rushed by the body-guard to the
wardrobe, and vaulted upon the top of that
familiar friendly refuge. He thought that on
top of the wardrobe he would be near the
secret door, and that, by watching an opportunity
he could drop down, unbolt the door,
and admit the Pin Elves. But now, to his
chagrin, he noticed that the wardrobe had been
moved some distance away from the secret
door.</p>

<p>The Gnomes, at his appearance, stood for a
moment in silent astonishment, for they supposed
him to be still lying bound where they
had thrown him, in the Passage of the Toad.
But they speedily recovered themselves, and
crowded around the wardrobe, yelling and
howling with rage.</p>

<p>“Build a fire and smoke him out!” growled
the King.</p>

<p>Immediately the wood was brought and laid
in a semicircle and ignited, the powder was
sprinkled upon the flame, and a dense, stifling
smoke enveloped the boy.</p>

<p>“I must run for it,” thought he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>He stood it as long as he could, and then he
dropped to the floor, leaped through the smoke
and flame, dashed through the mass of Gnomes
about the fire, and ran towards the dais.</p>

<p>The Gnomes had been expecting him to do
this, and had prepared for it. They had twisted
together a number of their strongest ropes, and
several lengths of this twisted rope were laid in
various places along the floor, with fifty Gnomes
holding the end of each length. One of these
pieces of rope was stretched near the lower step
of the dais, directly across the path that Harry
was taking. Just before he reached it, the
Gnomes who were holding it by the ends raised
it several inches above the floor and hauled it
taut, and the boy tripped over it and fell sprawling
in front of the throne.</p>

<p>Before he could recover himself, the rope
was wound several times about his ankles, and
another piece was slipped over his head and
hauled so tightly about his neck as nearly to
strangle him. Both of his hands were still
free, and he managed to turn partly over and
grasp the rope around his neck and pull upon
one side of it hard enough to loosen it somewhat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>But by this time nearly all of the Gnomes
were about him, and presently they had ropes
wound around both of his hands, and he was
beyond the power of struggling.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. Harry
heard a shriek of terror from the throne, and
looking up, he saw the King of the Gnomes,
Cattisack, Grumpy, the Grand Prime Minister,
and the Grand Recorder, all simultaneously fall
forward from their seats and lie prone upon the
steps of the dais. At the same time he felt
the bonds about his neck and limbs loosen, and
everything around him became as still as death.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br>
<span class="fs80">ON TOP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For awhile the boy was too astonished to
move. At first he thought it was some trick
they were trying to play upon him; but when he
slipped the bonds from his neck and limbs without
meeting with any opposition, he concluded
that it could be no trick, and accordingly sprang
to his feet.</p>

<p>All of the Gnomes at that end of the Hall
were lying prostrate on the floor, rigid and
motionless, as if paralyzed. Harry turned one
of them over, and the little fellow lay staring
vacantly upwards with open eyes, and seemed
as lifeless as a china doll.</p>

<p>At the further end of the Hall a number were
running back and forth, and crying and shrieking
as though they were mad. Putting his
hand to his ear, Harry could hear them calling
out in terror, “The toad! the toad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>At the sound of those words Harry hastily
glanced about him, and soon discovered the
little hop-toad sitting on the floor close by,
blinking his eyes as if half-blinded by the light.
It seems that Harry had left the trap-door
open, and the little animal had hopped up the
steps and out into the Hall just in the nick of
time.</p>

<p>The boy danced about the creature, and
roared with laughter. “Ha, ha, ha! what a
lark!” he exclaimed. “The Gnomes are just as
much afraid of a toad as the Pin Elves. Hurrah,
little hoppy, you’ve saved the country!
Let me show you, old fellow, what a wonderful
power you possess.”</p>

<p>Picking up the animal, he ran to the other
end of the Hall, and as soon as he approached
the Gnomes there, they too fell down paralyzed
with fear.</p>

<p>“Good enough!” Harry cried; “we can
send them down below now! Let me call in
Wamby and the rest.”</p>

<p>He was on the point of unbolting the secret
door, when luckily he bethought himself.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” he cried; “that won’t do! We
don’t want to paralyze the Pin Elves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>He considered a moment, and then carried
the toad back to the passage, and placing him
on the top step, shut the trap-door. Then,
standing close to the door, he waited until the
Gnomes revived and tremblingly arose to their
feet.</p>

<p>“Listen to me!” he called, in commanding
tones. “Cattisack and Grumpy, stand over
there by the wardrobe and don’t move. Some
of you fellows gather all of your weapons together,
and pile them in the corner yonder.
And you,”—to the King of the Gnomes,—“take
off your crown and royal mantle, and
place them on the step beside your sceptre.
Now, all of you go through the antechamber
and down to the shore of the lake and wait
there. If you dare disobey my orders, I shall
come after you with the toad!”</p>

<p>When the last Gnome had gone, the boy
bolted the door behind them, and ran across
and opened the secret door. “Enter, King
Wamby,” he said, “and take possession of your
throne and kingdom.”</p>

<p>But the Pin Elves shrank back with fear and
loathing, and some of the nearest ones fell to
the ground, crying, “The toad! the toad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“What ails you?” exclaimed Harry. “There’s
no toad here; I put him back in the passage
and shut the door.”</p>

<p>“Then you must have touched him, Prince,”
said Kitey, “and it is the odor left upon your
hands that prostrates us.”</p>

<p>“What can I do?” Harry asked in perplexity.</p>

<p>“You must go down to the river and bathe
your hands,” answered Kitey. “Nothing but
running water will remove the deadly odor of
the toad. Here is my lantern-box,” and he
tossed the box at Harry’s feet.</p>

<p>The boy picked up the box in his handkerchief,
so as not to infect it with the odor, and
hastened down to the underground river, where
he washed his hands, and then went back to
the Reception Hall.</p>

<p>Then he directed some of the elves to go
down to the lake and take the Gnomes across
to their own country, and then bring all of the
ships back again.</p>

<p>“Now, Prince,” said Wamby, “I have given
orders for a grand royal banquet to be prepared.
Meanwhile, let us go to my private apartments
and rest awhile.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Harry had not as yet seen that part of the
Pin Elf dominions where the elves lived, and
his eyes fairly hung out with astonishment as
Wamby opened a number of doors and gave
him glimpses of the luxurious private rooms of
the Lord of the Safety-Pin, the Grand Prime
Minister, the Knights of the Breast-Pin, and
others of the nobility.</p>

<p>But, of course, none of them could compare
with the richness and splendor of the royal
apartments. In three of these rooms the floor
and walls were of pure gold. The first was the
well-known green-and-gold room, where the King
ordinarily held his court and dealt out justice;
here was contained the famous couch cut from
a single emerald. Next came the blue-and-gold
room, with its lovely turquoises and pale blue
silk hangings. Then, last, came the purple-and-gold
room, where few were permitted to
enter. It was lighted by the great royal
amethyst that once belonged to the King of
the Gnomes. On the floor a soft couch had
been formed of many purple rugs for Harry’s
repose, and the boy was very willing to throw
himself down upon it, after his arduous labors.</p>

<p>Presently little Kitey entered the apartment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
accompanied by Smithkin. The soldier, with
some embarrassment, bowed low to Wamby,
and said, “Your Majesty, I have come to ask
pardon for having turned traitor, and also to
restore to Prince Harry these jewels he gave
me as a bribe.”</p>

<p>He held out to Harry the three jewels, but
the boy exclaimed, “Keep them, old chap; you
have more than earned them by your bravery.”</p>

<p>“You have also earned pardon for your former
treachery,” said King Wamby, with a gracious
smile. “Here is the reward I promised
for the recovery of my hat,” handing him a
rich jewel and a small gold hat-pin, “and I
hereby restore you to your old position as commander
of my body-guard.”</p>

<p>When Smithkin had retired, Harry turned
to Kitey and exclaimed, “I say, little chap, why
on earth didn’t you tell me the Gnomes were
afraid of the toad?”</p>

<p>“Why,” replied Kitey, “I did tell you, long
ago, when you first found me in the Passage.”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t,” said Harry. “You simply
said that elves were afraid of the animal.”</p>

<p>“But Gnomes are elves,” returned Kitey.
“They are bad elves, it is true; but all elves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
good or bad, are afraid of toads. I thought of
course you knew that all the time.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had known it,” said the boy, “for
it would have saved us all that fighting. I
could easily have settled the old Gnomes at the
very beginning.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do with Cattisack and
Grumpy?” inquired Wamby.</p>

<p>“Make them common Pin Elves,” said
Harry; “then they will have no power and
influence to stir up trouble again.”</p>

<p>Just then a messenger announced that the
banquet was served, so they repaired to the
Grand Royal Reception Hall.</p>

<p>Harry hardly recognized it as the same room
he had recently left. The golden throne, the
marble steps of the dais, and everything else
had been furbished and polished to look like
new. Costly rugs of white mouse-skin nearly
covered the floor. The lofty ceiling was newly
festooned with many-colored gems that gave a
rare and beautiful light. In the centre of the
Hall were long rows of tables covered with all
kinds of tempting viands in dishes of pure
gold. The royal table was distinguished from
the others by being placed upon a low platform,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
and also by the exquisite precious stones that
adorned every one of the golden dishes.</p>

<p>At the head of this table, where Harry was
asked to seat himself, was a large pot-pie. The
boy examined it curiously, and asked Wamby
what it was.</p>

<p>“It is a blackbird pie,” said Wamby, “especially
prepared for you. I have heard that
mortals consider it a dainty dish to set before a
king.”</p>

<p>“Good enough!” exclaimed Harry. “‘Four
and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie!’ Very
kind of you, old chap, to take so much trouble
just for me.”</p>

<p>Without more ado they all fell to and had
a royal time, feasting to their hearts’ content.
When the dishes were well cleared of their
contents, Harry made a speech, congratulating
them on having effectually conquered the
wicked Gnomes. Then Wamby arose and
thanked the Prince, in the name of the Pin
Elves, for his timely assistance. Then little
Kitey made them all roar with laughter by a
comical and witty address on “Our Friend and
Enemy, the Toad.”</p>

<p>After the feasting and merriment was over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Harry declared that he must once more return
to the upper earth.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you remain always with us,
Prince Harry?” said Wamby.</p>

<p>“Thank you, little chap,” answered Harry,
“I’d like to stay, but I don’t want my folks to
worry about me. By the way, I am going to
take that poor little toad out with me.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better go out alone through
the Passage of the Toad,” said Wamby. “We
should like to accompany you to the entrance,
but of course we cannot do so if you carry the
toad with you.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Harry, “I can bid
you good-by here. I suppose after I am gone
you will all resume your regular work of pin-gathering.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Wamby; “and we shall
be obliged to work hard, for many good pins
have been ruined and lost in the late war. I
notice some of my men are hardly able to keep
their garments together, and I myself at present
haven’t a pin to give one of them. Even a
short war like ours is very expensive.”</p>

<p>The little fellows were very sad at parting
from their kind Prince. Harry had never seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
any of the elves cry, but poor little Kitey
looked as if he felt like crying, and even
Smithkin winked hard as he bade him farewell.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave your hat on the dais, Wamby,”
said the boy; and rising from the table, he
walked towards the trap-door.</p>

<p>Before he reached it he heard Kitey’s shrill
voice calling him, and the little fellow ran up
to him saying, “Here’s my lantern-box to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
light you on the way. You can keep it,
Prince, in memory of little Kitey.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear old chap,” said Harry,
slipping the tiny box into his pocket.</p>

<p>Mounting the steps of the dais, he turned
and waved a final farewell to them all, and then
took off Wamby’s hat and placed it on the
throne, and entered the trap-door. Wrapping
the toad in the piece of table-cloth that was
still lying in the passage, he carried the little
creature along with him.</p>

<p>In the chamber under the rock he found his
own hat where he had left it when he came
down. Placing it on his head, he mounted the
steps and peeped forth, and finding the coast
clear, sprang out into the open air, and the
trap-door of its own accord shut noiselessly
behind him.</p>

<p>The first thing he did was to place the door-pin
carefully in the little lantern-box for safe
keeping. Then he opened the piece of cloth
and placed the little toad on the ground, and
sitting down upon the rock, watched him as
he first blinked stupidly in the bright light.
Master Toad soon, however, gave a tremendous
hop, and disappeared in the bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Harry arose and went home thoughtfully,
almost wondering if he had been asleep and
dreamed of all these strange adventures. But
as he vividly recalled everything to mind, and
especially as he felt in his pocket the little
lantern-box given him by Kitey, he knew that
he had actually been among the Pin Elves.</p>
